And yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston\'s, secret opinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police. So would anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness. Syme looked up. \'Here comes Parsons,\' he said. Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, \'that bloody fool\'. Parsons, Winston\'s fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading his way across the room — a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face. At thirty- five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did, indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them both with a cheery \'Hullo, hullo!\' and sat down at the table, giving off an intense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.

Uniquement dans sa propre conscience\nqui, dans tous les cas, serait bientôt anéantie. Si tous les autres acceptaient\nle mensonge imposé par le Parti – si tous les rapports racontaient la même\nchose –, le mensonge passait dans l’histoire et devenait vérité. « Celui\nqui a le contrôle du passé, disait le slogan du Parti, a le contrôle du futur.\nCelui qui a le contrôle du présent a le contrôle du passé. » Et cependant\nle passé, bien que par nature susceptible d’être modifié, n’avait jamais été\nretouché. La vérité actuelle, quelle qu’elle fût, était vraie d’un infini à un\nautre infini. C’était tout à fait simple. Ce qu’il fallait à chacun, c’était\navoir en mémoire une interminable série de victoires. Cela s’appelait\n« Contrôle de la Réalité ». On disait en novlangue, double pensée.\n— Repos ! aboya la\nmonitrice, un peu plus cordialement.\nWinston laissa tomber ses bras et\nremplit lentement d’air ses poumons. Son esprit s’échappa vers le labyrinthe de\nla double-pensée. Connaître et ne pas connaître. En pleine conscience et avec\nune absolue bonne foi, émettre des mensonges soigneusement agencés. Retenir\nsimultanément deux opinions qui s’annulent alors qu’on les sait contradictoires\net croire à toutes deux. Employer la logique contre la logique. Répudier la\nmorale alors qu’on se réclame d’elle. Croire en même temps que la démocratie\nest impossible et que le Parti est gardien de la démocratie. Oublier tout ce\nqu’il est nécessaire d’oublier, puis le rappeler à sa mémoire quand on en a\nbesoin, pour l’oublier plus rapidement encore. Surtout, appliquer le même\nprocessus au processus lui-même. Là était l’ultime subtilité. Persuader\nconsciemment l’inconscient, puis devenir ensuite inconscient de l’acte\nd’hypnose que l’on vient de perpétrer. La compréhension même du mot\n« double pensée » impliquait l’emploi de la double pensée.\nLa monitrice les avait rappelés au\ngarde-à-vous.\n— Voyons maintenant, dit-elle\navec enthousiasme, quels sont ceux d’entre nous qui peuvent toucher leurs\norteils. Droits sur les hanches, camarades ! Un-deux ! Un-deux !…\nWinston détestait cet exercice qui\nprovoquait, des talons aux fesses, des élancements douloureux et finissait par\nprovoquer une autre quinte de toux. Ses méditations en perdirent leur agrément\nmitigé. Le passé, réfléchit-il, n’avait pas été seulement modifié, il avait été\nbel et bien détruit. Comment en effet établir, même le fait le plus patent,\ns’il n’en existait aucun enregistrement que celui d’une seule mémoire ? Il\nessaya de se rappeler en quelle année il avait pour la première fois entendu\nparler de Big Brother. Ce devait être vers les années 60, mais comment en\nêtre sûr ? Dans l’histoire du Parti, naturellement, Big Brother figurait\ncomme chef et gardien de la Révolution depuis les premiers jours. Ses exploits\navaient été peu à peu reculés dans le temps et ils s’étendaient maintenant\njusqu’au monde fabuleux des années 40 et 30, à l’époque où les\ncapitalistes, coiffés d’étranges chapeaux cylindriques, parcouraient les rues\nde Londres dans de grandes automobiles étincelantes ou dans des voitures\nvitrées tirées par des chevaux. Il était impossible de savoir jusqu’à quel\npoint la légende de Big Brother était vraie ou inventée. Winston ne pouvait\nmême pas se rappeler à quelle date le Parti lui-même était né. Il ne croyait\npas avoir jamais entendu le mot Angsoc avant 1960, mais il était possible que\nsous la forme « Socialisme anglais » qu’il avait dans l’Ancien\nLangage, il eût existé plus tôt. Tout se fondait dans le brouillard. Parfois,\ncertainement, on pouvait poser le doigt sur un mensonge précis. Il était faux,\npar exemple, que le Parti, ainsi que le clamaient les livres d’histoire, eût\ninventé les aéroplanes. Winston se souvenait d’avoir vu des aéroplanes dès sa\nplus tendre enfance. Mais on ne pouvait rien prouver. Il n’y avait jamais de\ntémoignage. Une seule fois, dans toute son existence, Winston avait tenu entre\nles mains la preuve écrite indéniable de la falsification d’un fait historique.\nEt cette fois-là…\n— Smith ! cria la voix\nacariâtre dans le télécran, 6079 Smith W ! Oui, vous-même !\nBaissez-vous plus bas, s’il vous plaît ! Vous pouvez faire mieux que cela.\nVous ne faites pas d’efforts. Plus bas, je vous prie ! Cette fois c’est\nmieux, camarade. Maintenant, repos, tous, et regardez-moi.\nLe corps de Winston s’était\nbrusquement recouvert d’une ondée de sueur chaude, mais son visage demeura\nabsolument impassible. Ne jamais montrer d’épouvante ! Ne jamais montrer\nde ressentiment ! Un seul frémissement des yeux peut vous trahir. Winston\nresta debout à regarder tandis que la monitrice levait les bras au-dessus de la\ntête et, on ne pouvait dire avec grâce, mais avec une précision et une\nefficacité remarquables, se courba et rentra sous ses orteils la première\nphalange de ses doigts.\n— Voilà, camarades ! Voilà\ncomment je veux vous voir faire ce mouvement. Regardez-moi. J’ai trente-neuf\nans et j’ai quatre enfants. Maintenant, attention ! – Elle se pencha de\nnouveau. – Vous voyez que mes genoux ne sont pas pliés. Vous pouvez tous le\nfaire, si vous voulez, ajouta-t-elle en se redressant. N’importe qui,\nau-dessous de quarante-cinq ans, est parfaitement capable de toucher ses\norteils. Nous n’avons pas tous le privilège de nous battre sur le front, mais\nnous pouvons au moins nous garder en forme. Pensez à nos garçons qui sont sur\nle front de Malabar ! Pensez aux marins des Forteresses flottantes !\nImaginez ce qu’ils ont, eux, à endurer. Maintenant, essayez encore. C’est\nmieux, camarade, beaucoup mieux, ajouta-t-elle sur un ton encourageant, comme\nWinston, pour la première fois depuis des années, réussissait, d’un brusque\nmouvement, à toucher ses orteils sans plier les genoux.\n\n\nTable of ','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('023b4e8b-89d4-4f6e-9968-ad7f10edaa03','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',261,'cialist movement and inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme; with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been made permanent. But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this. There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power. Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to come into being, or it loses its own selfconfidence and willingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself. After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality disappeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert. The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed. The recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without ','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('0412bb8e-0e3c-407a-af5a-6fc9e82967ca','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',121,'if it so happened that you wanted to buy it, that\'d cost you four dollars.

What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, and for that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winston realized that he would have accepted three or even two. \"There\'s another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,\' he said. \'There\'s not much in it. Just a few pieces. We\'ll do with a light if we\'re going upstairs.\' He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney-pots.

As for the problem of over-production, which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare (see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting- off of a new group of able, under- employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational. It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it. The consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way. Given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already, the general structure of Oceanic society. At the apex of the pyramid comes Big Brother. Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful. Every success, every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration.

We may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born.

With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above Mr Charrington\'s shop. He was tired, but not sleepy any longer. He opened the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee. Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. He sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case. A heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the cover. The print also looked slightly irregular. The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed through many hands. The inscription on the title-page ran: 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('08fb7abb-8e18-4f72-9773-e3a05da4efcb','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',76,'ways in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety, rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces, bread dark- coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes insufficient — nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though, of course, it grew worse as one\'s body aged, was it not a sign that this was NOT the natural order of things, if one\'s heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness of one\'s socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil tastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different? He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type set up by the Party as an ideal — tall muscular youths and deep -bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree— existed and even predominated.

The white light and the humming sound were the same as ever, but the cell was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in. There was a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had given him a bath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin. They even gave him warm water to wash with. They had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls. They had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment. They had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures. Weeks or months must have passed. It would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time, if he had felt any interest in doing so, since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals. He was getting, he judged, three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. The food was surprisingly good, with meat at every third meal. Once there was even a packet of cigarettes. He had no matches, but the never-speaking guard who brought his food would give him a light. The first time he tried to smoke it made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out for a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal. 346 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('0a6dde1d-0bdc-4280-b4bd-8017ba732c34','2024-04-05 05:06:48','2024-04-05 05:06:48','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',6,'épais\ncheveux noirs, au visage couvert de taches de rousseur, à l’allure vive et\nsportive. Une étroite ceinture rouge, emblème de la Ligue Anti-Sexe des\nJuniors, plusieurs fois enroulée à sa taille, par-dessus sa combinaison, était\njuste assez serrée pour faire ressortir la forme agile et dure de ses hanches.\nWinston l’avait détestée dès le premier coup d’œil. Il savait pourquoi. C’était\nà cause de l’atmosphère de terrain de hockey, de bains froids, de randonnées en\ncommun, de rigoureuse propreté morale qu’elle s’arrangeait pour transporter\navec elle. Il détestait presque toutes les femmes, surtout celles qui étaient\njeunes et jolies. C’étaient toujours les femmes, et spécialement les jeunes,\nqui étaient les bigotes du Parti : avaleuses de slogans, espionnes\namateurs, dépisteuses d’hérésies. Mais cette fille en particulier lui donnait\nl’impression qu’elle était plus dangereuse que les autres. Une fois, alors\nqu’ils se croisaient dans le corridor, elle lui avait lancé un rapide regard de\ncôté qui semblait le transpercer et l’avait rempli un moment d’une atroce terreur.\nL’idée lui avait même traversé l’esprit qu’elle était peut-être un agent de la\nPolice de la Pensée. C’était à vrai dire très improbable. Néanmoins, il\ncontinuait à ressentir un malaise particulier, fait de frayeur autant que\nd’hostilité, chaque fois qu’elle se trouvait près de lui quelque part.\nL’autre personne était un homme\nnommé O’Brien, membre du Parti intérieur. Il occupait un poste si important et\nsi élevé que Winston n’avait qu’une idée obscure de ce qu’il pouvait être. Un\nsilence momentané s’établit dans le groupe des personnes qui entouraient les\nchaises quand elles virent approcher sa combinaison noire, celle d’un membre du\nParti intérieur. O’Brien était un homme grand et corpulent, au cou épais, au\nvisage rude, brutal et caustique. En dépit de cette formidable apparence, il\navait un certain charme dans les manières. Il avait une façon d’assurer ses\nlunettes sur son nez qui était curieusement désarmante – et, d’une manière\nindéfinissable, curieusement civilisée. C’était un geste qui, si quelqu’un\npouvait encore penser en termes semblables, aurait rappelé celui d’un homme du\nXVIIIe offrant sa tabatière. Winston avait vu O’Brien une douzaine\nde fois peut-être, dans un nombre presque égal d’années. Il se sentait vivement\nattiré par lui. Ce n’était pas seulement parce qu’il était intrigué par le\ncontraste entre l’urbanité des manières d’O’Brien et son physique de champion\nde lutte. C’était, beaucoup plus, à cause de la croyance secrète – ce n’était\npeut-être même pas une croyance, mais seulement un espoir – que l’orthodoxie de\nla politique d’O’Brien n’était pas parfaite. Quelque chose dans son visage le\nsuggérait irrésistiblement. Mais peut-être n’était-ce même pas la\nnon-orthodoxie qui était inscrite sur son visage, mais, simplement,\nl’intelligence. De toute façon, il paraissait être quelqu’un à qui l’on\npourrait parler si l’on pouvait duper le télécran et le voir seul. Winston\nn’avait jamais fait le moindre effort pour vérifier cette supposition ; en\nvérité, il n’y avait aucun moyen de la vérifier. O’Brien, à ce moment, regarda\nson bracelet-montre, vit qu’il était près de onze heures et décida, de toute\névidence, de rester dans le Commissariat aux Archives jusqu’à la fin des Deux\nMinutes de la Haine. Il prit une chaise sur le même rang que Winston, deux\nplaces plus loin. Une petite femme rousse, qui travaillait dans la cellule\nvoisine de celle de Winston, les séparait. La fille aux cheveux noirs était\nassise immédiatement derrière eux.\nUn instant plus tard, un horrible\ncrissement, comme celui de quelque monstrueuse machine tournant sans huile,\néclata dans le grand télécran du bout de la salle. C’était un bruit à vous\nfaire grincer des dents et à vous hérisser les cheveux. La Haine avait\ncommencé.\nComme d’habitude, le visage\nd’Emmanuel Goldstein, l’Ennemi du Peuple, avait jailli sur l’écran. Il y eut\ndes coups de sifflet çà et là dans l’assistance. La petite femme rousse jeta un\ncri de frayeur et de dégoût. Goldstein était le renégat et le traître. Il y\navait longtemps (combien de temps, personne ne le savait exactement) il avait\nété l’un des meneurs du Parti presque au même titre que Big Brother lui-même.\nIl s’était engagé dans une activité contre-révolutionnaire, avait été condamné\nà mort, s’était mystérieusement échappé et avait disparu. Le programme des Deux\nMinutes de la Haine variait d’un jour à l’autre, mais il n’y en avait pas dans\nlequel Goldstein ne fût la principale figure. Il était le traître fondamental,\nle premier profanateur de la pureté du Parti. Tous les crimes subséquents\ncontre le Parti, trahisons, actes de sabotage, hérésies, déviations,\njaillissaient directement de son enseignement. Quelque part, on ne savait où,\nil vivait encore et ourdissait des conspirations. Peut-être au-delà des mers,\nsous la protection des maîtres étrangers qui le payaient. Peut-être, comme on\nle murmurait parfois, dans l’Océania même, en quelque lieu secret.\nLe diaphragme de Winston s’était\ncontracté. Il ne pouvait voir le visage de Goldstein sans éprouver un pénible\nmélange d’émotions. C’était un mince visage de Juif, largement auréolé de\ncheveux blancs vaporeux, qui portait une barbiche en forme de bouc, un visage\nintelligent et pourtant méprisable par quelque chose qui lui était propre, avec\nune sorte de sottise sénile dans le long nez mince sur lequel, près de l’extrémité,\nétait perchée une paire de lunettes. Ce visage ressemblait à celui d’un mouton,\net la voix, elle aussi, était du genre bêlant. Goldstein débitait sa venimeuse\nattaque habituelle contre les doctrines du Parti. Une attaque si exagérée et si\nperverse qu’un enfant aurait pu la percer à jour, et cependant juste assez\nplausible pour emplir chacun de la crainte que d’autres, moins bien équilibrés\npussent s’y laisser prendre.

It might have planted a few doubts here and there, supposing that I\'d dared to show it to anybody. I don\'t imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime.

In the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest. Whenever he began to talk of the principles of Ingsoc, doublethink, the mutability of the past, and the denial of objective reality, and to use Newspeak words, she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of thing. One knew that it was all rubbish, so why let oneself be worried by it? She knew when to cheer and when to boo, and that was all one needed. If he persisted in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep. She was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position.

This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built.

Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a Tube station. There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and other people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above the other. Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In his childish way Winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemed to him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved — a little granddaughter, perhaps — had been killed. Every few minutes the old man kept repeating: \'We didn\'t ought to \'ave trusted \'em. I said so, Ma, didn\'t I?

That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better. That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was that when O\'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his face. O\'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew what the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He had understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was justified by the ultimate purpose.

The Parsons\' flat was bigger than Winston\'s, and dingy in a different way. Everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal. Games impedimenta — hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out — lay all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books. On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There was the usual boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which — one knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to say how — was the sweat of some person not present at the moment. In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen. \'It\'s the children,\' said Mrs Parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glance at the door. \'They haven\'t been out today.

Two other voices were speaking. After a moment Winston recognized one of them as his own. It was a sound-track of the conversation he had had with O\'Brien, on the night when he had enrolled himself in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal, to forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child\'s face. O\'Brien made a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making.

One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen. That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great purges involving thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought- criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years. More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some cases they might not even be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another. Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself. It was perfectly possible.

For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly But to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.

He walked casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another two seconds would do it. Then a voice behind him called, \'Smith!\' He pretended not to hear. \'Smith!\' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round. A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not safe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it. The girl\'s table filled up a few minutes later. But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would take the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely enough, she was at a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl\'s table. His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at a table further away, but something in the little man\'s appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table.

Une\nseule fois, au cours de sa vie – après l’événement, c’est ce qui comptait –, il\navait possédé la preuve palpable, irréfutable, d’un acte de falsification. Il\nl’avait tenue entre ses doigts au moins trente secondes. Ce devait être en\n1973. En tout cas, c’était à peu près à l’époque où Catherine et lui s’étaient\nséparés. Mais la date à considérer était antérieure de sept ou huit années.\nL’histoire commença en vérité vers\n1965, à l’époque des grandes épurations par lesquelles les premiers meneurs de\nla Révolution furent balayés pour toujours. Vers 1970, il n’en restait aucun,\nsauf Big Brother lui-même. Tous les autres, à ce moment, avaient été démasqués\ncomme traîtres et contre-révolutionnaires. Goldstein s’était enfui, et se\ncachait nul ne savait où. Pour ce qui était des autres, quelques-uns avaient\nsimplement disparu. Mais la plupart avaient été exécutés après de\nspectaculaires procès publics au cours desquels ils confessaient leurs crimes.\nParmi les derniers survivants, il y\navait trois hommes nommés Jones, Aaronson et Rutherford. Ce devait être en 1965\nque ces trois-là avaient été arrêtés. Comme il arrivait souvent, ils avaient\ndisparu pendant plus d’un an, de sorte qu’on ne savait pas s’ils étaient\nvivants ou morts puis, soudain, on les avait ramenés à la lumière afin qu’ils\ns’accusent, comme à l’ordinaire.\nIls s’étaient accusés d’intelligence\navec l’ennemi (à cette date aussi, l’ennemi c’était l’Eurasia), de détournement\ndes fonds publics, du meurtre de divers membres fidèles au Parti, d’intrigues\ncontre la direction de Big Brother, qui avaient commencé longtemps avant la\nRévolution, d’actes de sabotage qui avaient causé la mort de centaines de\nmilliers de personnes. Après ces confessions, ils avaient été pardonnés,\nréintégrés dans le Parti et nommés à des postes honorifiques qui étaient en\nfait des sinécures. Tous trois avaient écrit de longs et abjects articles dans\nle Times pour analyser les raisons de leur défection et promettre de\ns’amender.\nQuelque temps après leur libération,\nWinston les avait vus tous trois au Café du Châtaignier. Il se rappelait cette\nsorte de fascination terrifiée qui l’avait incité à les regarder du coin de\nl’œil.\nC’étaient des hommes beaucoup plus\nâgés que lui, des reliques de l’ancien monde, les dernières grandes figures\npeut-être des premiers jours héroïques du Parti. Le prestige de la lutte\nclandestine et de la guerre civile s’attachait encore à eux dans une faible\nmesure. Winston avait l’impression, bien que déjà à cette époque, les faits et\nles dates fussent confus, qu’il avait su leurs noms bien des années avant celui\nde Big Brother. Mais ils étaient aussi des hors-la-loi, des ennemis, des\nintouchables, dont le destin, inéluctable, était la mort dans une année ou\ndeux. Aucun de ceux qui étaient tombés une fois entre les mains de la Police de\nla Pensée, n’avait jamais, en fin de compte, échappé. C’étaient des corps qui\nattendaient d’être renvoyés à leurs tombes.\nAux tables qui les entouraient, il\nn’y avait personne. Il n’était pas prudent d’être même seulement vu dans le\nvoisinage de telles personnes. Ils étaient assis silencieux, devant des verres\nde gin parfumé au clou de girofle qui était la spécialité du café. Des trois,\nc’était Rutherford qui avait le plus impressionné Winston.\nRutherford avait, à un moment, été\nun caricaturiste fameux dont les dessins cruels avaient aidé à enflammer\nl’opinion avant et après la Révolution. Maintenant encore, à de longs\nintervalles, ses caricatures paraissaient dans le Times. Ce n’étaient\nque des imitations de sa première manière. Elles étaient curieusement sans vie\net peu convaincantes. Elles n’offraient qu’un rabâchage des thèmes\nanciens : logements des quartiers sordides, enfants affamés, batailles de\nrues, capitalistes en haut-de-forme (même sur les barricades, les capitalistes\nsemblaient encore s’attacher à leurs hauts-de-forme). C’était un effort infini\net sans espoir pour revenir au passé. Rutherford était un homme monstrueux, aux\ncheveux gris, graisseux, en crinière, au visage couturé, à la peau fiasque, aux\népaisses lèvres négroïdes. Il devait avoir été extrêmement fort. Mais son grand\ncorps s’affaissait, s’inclinait, devenait bossu, s’éparpillait dans tous les\nsens. Il semblait s’effondrer sous les yeux des gens comme une montagne qui\ns’émiette.\nIl était trois heures de\nl’après-midi, heure où il n’y a personne. Winston ne pouvait maintenant se\nsouvenir comment il avait pu se trouver au café à cette heure-là. L’endroit\nétait presque vide. Une musique douce coulait lentement des télécrans. Les\ntrois hommes étaient assis dans leur coin, presque sans bouger, et sans parler.\nLe garçon, sans attendre la commande, apporta des verres de gin frais. Il y\navait à côté d’eux, sur la table, un jeu d’échecs dont les pièces étaient en\nplace, mais aucun jeu n’avait commencé. Il arriva alors un accident au\ntélécran, pendant peut-être une demi-minute. L’air qui se jouait changea et le\nton de la musique aussi. Il y eut alors… mais c’était un son difficile à\ndécrire, c’était une note spéciale, syncopée, dans laquelle entrait du\nbraiement et du rire. Winston l’appela en lui-même une note jaune.

Do you know that Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?\' Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of the dark- coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on: \'Don\'t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we\'re not far from that point. But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, of course, there\'s no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime. It\'s merely a question of self-discipline, reality- control. But in the end there won\'t be any need even for that. The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak,\' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. \'Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?\' \'Except  \' began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped. It had been on the tip of his tongue to say \'Except the proles,\' but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that  67','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('0ef196ce-898b-4adc-8918-7642ecdd5d46','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',253,'den. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already. He had just turned back to Chapter I when he heard Julia\'s footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag on the floor and flung herself into his arms. It was more than a week since they had seen one another. \'I\'ve got THE BOOK,\' he said as they disentangled themselves. \'Oh, you\'ve got it? Good,\' she said without much interest, and almost immediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffee. They did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour. The evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane. From below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones. The brawny red-armed woman whom Winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard. There seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song. Julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep. He reached out for the book, which was lying on the floor, and sat up against the bedhead. \'We must read it,\' he said. \'You too. All members of the Brotherhood have to read it.\' \'You read it,\' she said with her eyes shut. \'Read it aloud. That\'s the best way.

They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters. By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course, had always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant change. In the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the High.

The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. From the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip. \'Just the man I was looking for,\' said a voice at Winston\'s back. He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in the Research Department. Perhaps \'friend\' was not exactly the right word. You did not have friends nowadays, you had comrades: but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, a specialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. He was a tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large, protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you. \'I wanted to ask you whether you\'d got any razor blades,\' he said. \'Not one!\' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. \'I\'ve 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('13c8f28e-ca63-4c89-a118-b9afc70b7687','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',145,'men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed close together.

The girl\'s shoulder, and her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks. \'Can you hear me?\' \'Yes.\' \'Can you get Sunday afternoon off?\' \'Yes.\' \'Then listen carefully.

Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to BELIEVE that black is white, and more, to KNOW that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK. The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising. But by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the Party. It is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in all cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one\'s mind, or even one\'s policy, is a confession of weakness.

A riot! The proles are breaking loose at last! When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. The successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another\'s hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off. Winston watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?

A time came when, if it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were six prisoners in the cell, men and women. All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat a man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large, harmless rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone\'s eye. The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent a momentary chill through Winston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking man who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. But what was startling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. Because of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the eyes seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or something. The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston. Winston did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes. Suddenly he realized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation. The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell.

In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while POWER remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('161dd48a-b8ca-4e24-a675-67418843c704','2024-04-05 05:06:49','2024-04-05 05:06:49','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',11,' Ils étaient tous deux revêtus du\nshort bleu, de la chemise grise et du foulard rouge qui composaient l’uniforme\ndes Espions.\nWinston leva les mains au-dessus de\nsa tête, mais l’attitude du garçon était à ce point malveillante qu’il en\néprouvait un malaise et le sentiment que ce n’était pas tout à fait un jeu.\n— Vous êtes un traître, hurla\nle garçon. Vous trahissez par la pensée ! Vous êtes un espion\neurasien !

C’était une chance pour Winston que le pistolet ne fût\npas un vrai pistolet.\nLes yeux de Mme Parsons\nvoltigèrent nerveusement de Winston aux enfants et inversement. Winston, dans\nla lumière plus vive du living-room, remarqua avec intérêt qu’elle avait\nvéritablement de la poussière dans les plis de son visage.\n— Ils sont si bruyants !\ndit-elle. Ils sont désappointés parce qu’ils ne peuvent aller voir la\npendaison. C’est pour cela.

Cela se répétait chaque mois environ et c’était un\nspectacle populaire. Les enfants criaient pour s’y faire conduire.\nWinston salua Mme Parsons et\nsortit. Mais il n’avait pas fait six pas sur le palier que quelque chose le\nfrappait à la nuque. Le coup fut atrocement douloureux. C’était comme si on\nl’avait transpercé avec un fil de fer chauffé au rouge. Il se retourna juste à\ntemps pour voir Mme Parsons tirer son fils pour le faire rentrer tandis\nque le garçon mettait une fronde dans sa poche.\n« Goldstein ! » hurla\nle garçon, tandis que la porte se refermait sur lui. Mais ce qui frappa le plus\nWinston, ce fut l’expression de frayeur impuissante du visage grisâtre de la\nfemme.\nDe retour dans son appartement, il\npassa rapidement devant l’écran et se rassit devant la table, tout en se\nfrottant le cou. La musique du télécran s’était tue. Elle était remplacée par\nune voix coupante et militaire qui lisait, avec une sorte de plaisir brutal,\nune description de la nouvelle forteresse flottante qui venait d’être ancrée\nentre la Terre de Glace et les îles Féroé.\nCette pauvre femme, pensa Winston,\ndoit vivre dans la terreur de ses enfants. Dans un an ou deux, ils\nsurveilleront nuit et jour chez elle les symptômes de non-orthodoxie. Presque\ntous les enfants étaient maintenant horribles. Le pire c’est qu’avec des\norganisations telles que celle des Espions, ils étaient systématiquement\ntransformés en ingouvernables petits sauvages. Pourtant cela ne produisait chez\neux aucune tendance à se révolter contre la discipline du Parti. Au contraire,\nils adoraient le parti et tout ce qui s’y rapportait : les chansons, les\nprocessions, les bannières, les randonnées en bandes, les exercices avec des\nfusils factices, l’aboiement des slogans, le culte de Big Brother. C’était pour\neux comme un jeu magnifique. Toute leur férocité était extériorisée contre les\nennemis de l’État, contre les étrangers, les traîtres, les saboteurs, les\ncriminels par la pensée. Il était presque normal que des gens de plus de trente\nans aient peur de leurs propres enfants. Et ils avaient raison. Il se passait\nen effet rarement une semaine sans qu’un paragraphe du Times ne relatât comment\nun petit mouchard quelconque – « enfant héros », disait-on – avait,\nen écoutant aux portes, entendu une remarque compromettante et dénoncé ses\nparents à la Police de la Pensée.\nLa brûlure causée par le projectile\ns’était éteinte. Winston prit sa plume sans entrain. Il se demandait s’il\ntrouverait quelque chose de plus à écrire dans son journal. Tout d’un coup, sa\npensée se reporta vers O’Brien.\nIl y avait longtemps – combien de\ntemps ? sept ans, peut-être, – il avait rêvé qu’il traversait une salle où\nil faisait noir comme dans un four. Quelqu’un, assis dans cette salle, avait\ndit, alors que Winston passait devant lui : « Nous nous rencontrerons\nlà où il n’y a pas de ténèbres. » Ce fut dit calmement, comme par hasard.\nC’était une constatation, non un ordre. Winston était sorti sans s’arrêter. Le\ncurieux était qu’à ce moment, dans le rêve, les mots ne l’avaient pas beaucoup\nimpressionné. C’est seulement plus tard, et par degrés, qu’ils avaient pris\ntout leur sens. Il ne pouvait maintenant se rappeler si c’était avant ou après\nce rêve qu’il avait vu O’Brien pour la première fois. Il ne pouvait non plus se\nrappeler à quel moment il avait identifié la voix comme étant celle d’O’Brien.\nL’identification en tout cas était faite. C’était O’Brien qui avait parlé dans\nl’obscurité.\nWinston n’avait jamais pu savoir\navec certitude si O’Brien était un ami ou un ennemi. Même après le coup d’œil\nde ce matin, il était encore impossible de le savoir. Cela ne semblait pas\nd’ailleurs avoir une grande importance. Il y avait entre eux un lien basé sur\nla compréhension réciproque, qui était plus important que l’affection ou le\nrattachement à un même parti. « Nous nous rencontrerons là où il n’y a pas\nde ténèbres », avait dit O’Brien. Winston ne savait pas ce que cela\nsignifiait, il savait seulement que, d’une façon ou d’une autre, cela se\nréaliserait.\nLa voix du télécran se tut.

She stopped him. \'Don\'t go out into the open. There might be someone watching. We\'re all right if we keep behind the boughs.\' They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The sunlight, filtering through innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces. Winston looked out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of recognition. He knew it by sight. An old, closebitten pasture, with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women\'s hair. Surely somewhere nearby, but out of sight, there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming? \'Isn\'t there a stream somewhere near here?\' he whispered. \"That\'s right, there is a stream.

The dream had also been comprehended by — indeed, in some sense it had consisted in — a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the news film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopter blew them both to pieces. \'Do you know,\' he said, \'that until this moment I believed I had murdered my mother?\' \'Why did you murder her?\' said Julia, almost asleep. \'I didn\'t murder her.

But what most struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman\'s greyish face. Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck. The music from the telescreen had stopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort of brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress which had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother — it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children.

Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to the world\'s economy. They add nothing to the wealth of the world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war. By their labour the slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the structure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself, would not be essentially different. The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward.

They did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were. Some things had happened, others had not happened. He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again. Almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter. He had started as though a pin had run into him. A shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was the bulletin! Victory! It always meant victory when a trumpet-call preceded the news. A sort of electric drill ran through the cafe. Even the waiters had started and pricked up their ears. The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of noise. Already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside. The news had run round the streets like magic.

Le Parti ne pouvait être\nrenversé de l’intérieur. Ses ennemis, s’il en avait, ne possédaient aucun moyen\nde se grouper ou même de se reconnaître les uns les autres. Si même la légendaire\nFraternité existait, ce qui était possible, il était inconcevable que ses\nmembres puissent se rassembler en nombre supérieur à deux ou trois. La\nrébellion, chez eux, c’était un regard des yeux, une inflexion de voix, au\nplus, un mot chuchoté à l’occasion. Mais les prolétaires n’auraient pas besoin\nde conspirer, si seulement ils pouvaient, d’une façon ou d’une autre, prendre\nconscience de leur propre force. Ils n’avaient qu’à se dresser et se secouer\ncomme un cheval qui s’ébroue pour chasser les mouches. S’ils le voulaient, ils\npouvaient dès le lendemain souffler sur le Parti et le mettre en pièces.\nSûrement, tôt ou tard, il leur viendrait à l’idée de le faire ? Et\npourtant !\nIl se souvint qu’une fois, alors\nqu’il descendait une rue bondée de gens, une effrayante clameur d’une centaine\nde voix, des voix de femmes, avait éclaté un peu plus loin, dans une rue\ntransversale. C’était un formidable cri de colère et de désespoir, un\n« Oh-o-o-oh ! » profond et retentissant dont l’écho se prolongeait\ncomme le son d’une cloche. Son cœur avait bondi. « On a commencé avait-il\npensé. Une émeute ! À la fin, les prolétaires brisent leurs\nchaînes. »\nQuand il arriva à l’endroit du\nvacarme, ce fut pour voir une cohue de deux ou trois cents femmes pressées\nautour des étals d’un marché en plein air. Elles avaient des visages aussi\ntragiques que si elles avaient été les passagers condamnés d’un bateau en train\nde sombrer. Mais à ce moment, le désespoir général se brisa en une multitude de\nquerelles individuelles. Il apparut qu’à un des étals on vendait des casseroles\nde fer-blanc. C’était une camelote misérable, mais les ustensiles de cuisine\nétaient toujours difficiles à obtenir. Le stock s’était brusquement épuisé. Les\nfemmes qui avaient réussi à en avoir, poussées et bousculées par les autres,\nessayaient de se retirer avec leurs casseroles, tandis que des douzaines\nd’autres criaient autour de l’étal, accusaient le vendeur de favoritisme et\nprétendaient qu’il avait des casseroles en réserve quelque part.\nIl y eut une nouvelle explosion de\nglapissements. Deux femmes énormes, dont l’une avait les cheveux défaits,\ns’étaient emparées de la même casserole et essayaient de se l’arracher l’une\nl’autre des mains. Elles tirèrent violemment toutes deux un moment, puis le\nmanche se détacha : Winston les regarda avec dégoût.\nPourtant, quelle puissance presque\neffrayante avait un moment sonné dans ce cri jailli de quelques centaines de\ngosiers seulement. Comment se faisait-il qu’ils ne pouvaient jamais crier ainsi\npour des raisons importantes ? Winston écrivit :\nIls ne se révolteront que\nlorsqu’ils seront devenus conscients et ils ne pourront devenir conscients\nqu’après s’être révoltés.\n« Cela, pensa-t-il, pourrait\npresque être une transcription de l’un des manuels du Parti. » Le Parti prétendait,\nnaturellement, avoir délivré les prolétaires de l’esclavage. Avant la\nRévolution, ils étaient hideusement opprimés par les capitalistes. Ils étaient\naffamés et fouettés. Les femmes étaient obligées de travailler dans des mines\nde charbon (des femmes, d’ailleurs, travaillaient encore dans des mines de\ncharbon). Les enfants étaient vendus aux usines à l’âge de six ans.\nMais en même temps que ces\ndéclarations, en vertu des principes de la double-pensée, le Parti enseignait\nque les prolétaires étaient des inférieurs naturels, qui devaient être tenus en\nétat de dépendance, comme les animaux, par l’application de quelques règles\nsimples. En réalité, on savait peu de chose des prolétaires. Il n’était pas\nnécessaire d’en savoir beaucoup. Aussi longtemps qu’ils continueraient à\ntravailler et à engendrer, leurs autres activités seraient sans importance.\nLaissés à eux-mêmes, comme le bétail lâché dans les plaines de l’Argentine, ils\nétaient revenus à un style de vie qui leur paraissait naturel, selon une sorte\nde canon ancestral. Ils naissaient, ils poussaient dans la rue, ils allaient au\ntravail à partir de douze ans. Ils traversaient une brève période de beauté\nflorissante et de désir, ils se mariaient à vingt ans, étaient en pleine\nmaturité à trente et mouraient, pour la plupart, à soixante ans. Le travail\nphysique épuisant, le souci de la maison et des enfants, les querelles\nmesquines entre voisins, les films, le football, la bière et, surtout, le jeu,\nformaient tout leur horizon et comblaient leurs esprits. Les garder sous\ncontrôle n’était pas difficile. Quelques agents de la Police de la Pensée\ncirculaient constamment parmi eux, répandaient de fausses rumeurs, notaient et\néliminaient les quelques individus qui étaient susceptibles de devenir\ndangereux.\nOn n’essayait pourtant pas de les\nendoctriner avec l’idéologie du Parti. Il n’était pas désirable que les\nprolétaires puissent avoir des sentiments politiques profonds. Tout ce qu’on\nleur demandait, c’était un patriotisme primitif auquel on pouvait faire appel\nchaque fois qu’il était nécessaire de leur faire accepter plus d’heures de\ntravail ou des rations plus réduites. Ainsi, même quand ils se fâchaient, comme\nils le faisaient parfois, leur mécontentement ne menait nulle part car il\nn’était pas soutenu par des idées générales. Ils ne pouvaient le concentrer que\nsur des griefs personnels et sans importance. Les maux plus grands échappaient\ninvariablement à leur attention. La plupart des prolétaires n’avaient même pas\nde télécrans chez eux. La police civile elle-même se mêlait très peu de leurs\naffaires.

How many times he had been beaten, how long the beatings had continued, he could not remember. Always there were five or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were times when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness. There were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: T will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will tell them what they want.\' Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again.

Hier, soirée\nau ciné. Rien que des films de guerre. Un très bon film montrait un navire\nplein de réfugiés, bombardé quelque part dans la Méditerranée. Auditoire très\namusé par les tentatives d’un gros homme gras qui essayait d’échapper en\nnageant à la poursuite d’un hélicoptère. On le voyait d’abord se vautrer dans\nl’eau comme un marsouin. Puis on l’apercevait à travers le viseur du canon de\nl’hélicoptère. Il était ensuite criblé de trous et la mer devenait rose autour\nde lui. Puis il sombrait aussi brusquement que si les trous avaient laissé\npénétrer l’eau. Le public riait à gorge déployée quand il s’enfonça. On vit\nensuite un canot de sauvetage plein d’enfants que survolait un hélicoptère. Une\nfemme d’âge moyen, qui était peut-être une Juive, était assise à l’avant, un\ngarçon d’environ trois ans dans les bras, petit garçon criait de frayeur et se\ncachait la tête entre les seins de sa mère comme s’il essayait de se terrer en\nelle et la femme l’entourait de ses bras et le réconfortait alors qu’elle était\nelle-même verte de frayeur, elle le recouvrait autant que possible comme si\nelle croyait que ses bras pourraient écarter de lui les balles, ensuite\nl’hélicoptère lâcha sur eux une bombe de vingt kilos qui éclata avec un éclair\nterrifiant et le bateau vola en éclats. Il y eut ensuite l’étonnante projection\nd’un bras d’enfant montant droit dans l’air, un hélicoptère muni d’une caméra a\ndû le suivre et il y eut des applaudissements nourris venant des fauteuils mais\nune femme qui se trouvait au poulailler s’est mise brusquement à faire du bruit\nen frappant du pied et en criant on ne doit pas montrer cela pas devant les\npetits on ne doit pas ce n’est pas bien pas devant les enfants ce n’est pas\njusqu’à ce que la police la saisisse et la mette à la porte je ne pense pas\nqu’il lui soit arrivé quoi que ce soit personne ne s’occupe de ce que disent\nles prolétaires les typiques réactions prolétaires jamais on -\nWinston s’arrêta d’écrire, en partie\nparce qu’il souffrait d’une crampe.

L’une était une fille\nqu’il croisait souvent dans les couloirs. Il ne savait pas son nom, mais il\nsavait qu’elle travaillait au Commissariat aux Romans.

Gelatinous was the right word. It had come into his head spontaneously. His body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly, but its translucency He felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood and lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations seemed to be magnified. His overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet, even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak. He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So had everyone else in the Ministry. Now it was all over, and he had literally nothing to do, no Party work of any descrip tion, until tomorrow morning. He could spend six hours in the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the direction of Mr Charrington\'s shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him.

C’était\npar un sombre après-midi, dans une étroite rue de traverse, près de l’une des\ngrandes gares de chemin de fer. Elle était debout près d’un porche, sous un\nréverbère qui éclairait à peine. Elle avait un visage jeune, recouvert d’une\népaisse couche de fard. C’est en réalité le fard qui m’attire, sa blancheur\nanalogue à celle d’un masque, et le rouge éclatant des lèvres. Les femmes du\nParti ne fardent jamais leur visage. Il n’y avait personne d’autre dans la rue,\npas de télécran. Elle dit deux dollars. Je…\nIl était pour l’instant trop\ndifficile de continuer. Winston ferma les yeux et les pressa de ses doigts,\npour essayer d’en expurger le tableau qui s’obstinait à revenir. Il sentait le\ndésir, presque irrésistible, de proférer à tue-tête un chapelet d’injures, ou\nde se cogner la tête contre le mur, ou de donner des coups de pieds à la table\net de lancer l’encrier par la fenêtre, de faire n’importe quoi de violent, de\nbruyant ou de douloureux qui pourrait brouiller et effacer le souvenir qui le\ntourmentait.\n« Le pire ennemi, réfléchit-il,\nest le système nerveux. À n’importe quel moment, la tension intérieure peut se\nmanifester par quelque symptôme visible. » Il pensa à un homme qu’il avait\ncroisé dans la rue il y avait quelques semaines, un homme d’aspect tout à fait\nquelconque, un membre du Parti, de trente-cinq ans ou quarante ans, assez\ngrand, mince, qui portait une serviette. Ils étaient à quelques mètres l’un de\nl’autre. Le côté gauche du visage de l’homme fut soudain tordu par une sorte de\nspasme. Cela se produisit encore juste quand ils se croisaient. Ce n’était qu’une\ncrispation, un frémissement, aussi rapide que le déclic d’un obturateur de\ncaméra, mais visiblement habituel. Winston se souvint d’avoir pensé à ce\nmoment : ce pauvre diable est perdu. L’effrayant était que ce tic était\npeut-être inconscient. Le danger le plus grand était celui de parler en\ndormant. Mais, autant que pouvait le savoir Winston, il n’y avait aucun moyen\nde se garantir contre ce danger-là.\nIl reprit son souffle et continua à\nécrire :\nJe la suivis à travers le porche\net une cour intérieure jusqu’à une cuisine en sous-sol. Il y avait un lit\ncontre le mur et, sur la table, une lampe dont la flamme était très basse.\nElle…\nLes dents de Winston étaient\nglacées. Il aurait aimé cracher. En même temps qu’à la femme du sous-sol, il\npensait à Catherine, sa femme. Il était marié, ou, tout au moins, s’était\nmarié. Il était probablement encore marié car, pour autant qu’il le sût, sa\nfemme n’était pas morte. Il lui sembla respirer encore la chaude odeur lourde\nde la cuisine du sous-sol, une odeur composée de punaises, de vêtements sales,\nde mauvais parfums à bon marché, mais pourtant attirante, parce que les femmes\ndu Parti ne se servaient jamais de parfum et on ne pouvait les imaginer\nparfumées. Seuls, les prolétaires se servaient de parfums. Dans son esprit,\nl’odeur était inextricablement mêlée à l’idée de fornication.\nSon aventure avec cette femme avait\nété son premier écart après deux ans environ. Fréquenter les prostituées était\nnaturellement défendu, mais c’était une de ces règles qu’on pouvait parfois prendre\nsur soi de transgresser. C’était dangereux, mais ce n’était pas une question de\nvie ou de mort. Être pris avec une prostituée pouvait signifier cinq ans de\ntravaux forcés, pas plus, si l’on n’avait commis aucune autre offense. Et\nc’était assez facile, pourvu qu’on pût éviter d’être pris sur le fait. Les\nquartiers pauvres fourmillaient de femmes prêtes à se vendre. Quelques-unes\npouvaient même être achetées avec une bouteille de gin, liquide que les\nprolétaires étaient censés ne pas boire.\nTacitement, le Parti était même\nenclin à encourager la prostitution pour laisser une soupape aux instincts qui\nne pouvaient être entièrement refoulés. La simple débauche n’avait pas beaucoup\nd’importance aussi longtemps qu’elle était furtive et sans joie et n’engageait\nque les femmes d’une classe méprisée et déshéritée. Le crime impardonnable\nétait le contact sexuel entre membres du Parti. Mais, bien que ce fût l’un des\ncrimes que les accusés confessaient invariablement lors des grandes épurations,\nil était difficile d’imaginer qu’un tel contact pourrait survenir actuellement.\nLe but du Parti n’était pas\nsimplement d’empêcher les hommes et les femmes de se vouer une fidélité qu’il\npourrait être difficile de contrôler. Son but inavoué, mais réel, était\nd’enlever tout plaisir à l’acte sexuel. Ce n’était pas tellement l’amour, mais\nl’érotisme qui était l’ennemi, que ce fût dans le mariage ou hors du mariage.\nTous les mariages entre membres du\nParti devaient être approuvés par un comité appointé et, bien que le principe\nn’en eût jamais été clairement établi, la permission était toujours refusée\nquand les membres du couple en question donnaient l’impression d’être\nphysiquement attirés l’un vers l’autre.\nLa seule fin du mariage qui fût\nadmise était de faire naître des enfants pour le service du Parti. Le commerce\nsexuel devait être considéré comme une opération sans importance, légèrement\ndégoûtante, comme de prendre un lavement. Cela non plus n’avait jamais été\nexprimé franchement mais, d’une manière indirecte, on le rabâchait dès\nl’enfance à tous les membres du Parti. Il y avait même des organisations, comme\ncelle de la ligue Anti-Sexe des Juniors, qui plaidaient en faveur du célibat\npour les deux sexes. Tous les enfants devraient être procréés par insémination\nartificielle (artsem, en novlangue) et élevés dans des institutions publiques.\nWinston savait que ce n’était pas avancé tout à fait sérieusement, mais ce\ngenre de concept s’accordait avec l’idéologie générale du Parti.\nLe Parti essayait de tuer l’instinct\nsexuel ou, s’il ne pouvait le tuer, de le dénaturer et de le salir.','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('22067660-e55e-4bcd-a378-9fef4d335be5','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',300,'breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was a different kind of cry. A kick from a guard\'s boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet. \'Room 101,\' said the officer. The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his crushed hand, all the fight had gone out of him. A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was sticky and evil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of O\'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought of Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he. She might be screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: \'If I could 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('2215f32b-f56b-4223-89a6-b47fed918fc9','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',18,'by the Thought Police. He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it. In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O\'Brien\'s heavy face was flushed. He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out \'Swine! Swine! Swine!\' and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck Goldstein\'s nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act 18 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('22cc9aa3-2ec1-4f52-84e6-66d83173a808','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',246,'that all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover. Although the Party, according to its habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about ten years later. At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, and North America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society, and hence of their own power. Thereafter, although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later. And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank, the submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use. And in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks, have never been repeated.

Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? Why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead. Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time? He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of O\'Brien. \'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,\' O\'Brien had said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that of O\'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?

He paused opposite Winston and began eagerly appealing to him: \'You don\'t think they\'ll shoot me, do you, old chap? They don\'t shoot you if you haven\'t actually done anything — only thoughts, which you can\'t help? I know they give you a fair hearing. Oh, I trust them for that!

It can get hold of you without your even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my sleep! Yes, that\'s a fact.

Tirelessly the woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He wondered whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. As he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching up for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him for the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and after all, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower? \'She\'s beautiful,\' he murmured. \'She\'s a metre across the hips, easily\' said Julia. \'That is her style of beauty\' said Winston. He held Julia\'s supple waist easily encircled by his arm. From the hip to the knee her flank was against his. Out of their bodies no child would ever come. That was the one thing they could never do. Only by word of mouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret.

Her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly. \'Julia.\' No answer. \'Julia, are you awake?\' No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it carefully on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet over both of them. He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. He understood HOW; he did not understand WHY. Chapter I, like Chapter III, had not actually told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad. A yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow. He shut his eyes. The sun on his face and the girl\'s smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, sleepy, confident feeling. He was safe, everything was all right. He fell asleep murmuring \'Sanity is not statistical,\' with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom. When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only twenty-thirty He lay dozing for a while; 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('26b2e0e6-dd06-45c8-9af5-777b88b62dcb','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',134,'to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body. \'You\'re hurt?\' he said. \'It\'s nothing. My arm. It\'ll be all right in a second.\' She spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had certainly turned very pale. \'You haven\'t broken anything?\' \'No, I\'m all right. It hurt for a moment, that\'s all.\' She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. She had regained some of her colour, and appeared very much better. \'It\'s nothing,\' she repeated shortly. \'I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang. Thanks, comrade!\' And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going, as briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one\'s feelings appear in one\'s face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no question that she had done it intentionally. It was something small and flat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.

The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor, studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions, gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist, physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more and more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship; others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun\'s rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth\'s centre.

He knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings. He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him. It struck him at once that she had changed in some ill-defined way. They almost passed one another without a sign, then he turned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that there was no danger, nobody would take any interest in him. She did not speak. She walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. Presently they were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It was vilely cold.

It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was three or four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature in each. They were rats. \'In your case,\' said O\'Brien, \'the worst thing in the world happens to be rats.\' A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had passed through Winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage. But at this moment the meaning of the mask- like attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed to turn to water. \'You can\'t do that!\' he cried out in a high cracked voice. \'You couldn\'t, you couldn\'t!

He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had heard O\'Brien\'s voice. All through his interrogation, although he had never seen him, he had had the feeling that O\'Brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. It was O\'Brien who was directing everything. It was he who set the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him. It was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once — Winston could not remember whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment of wakefulness — a voice murmured in his ear: \'Don\'t worry, Winston; you are in my keeping. For seven years I have watched over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shall save you, I shall make you perfect.\' He was not sure whether it was O\'Brien\'s voice; but it was the same voice that had said to him, \'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,\' in that other dream, seven years ago. He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually materialized round him.

It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops (\'dealing on the free market\', it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession. The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twentyfive years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil.

They seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered on to his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window. He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins. There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast. He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned down a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented (pubs\', they called them) were choked with customers.

The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. The past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory? He tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides.

She took it for granted that he, \'the boy\', should have the biggest portion; but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. At every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister\'s plate. He knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; he even felt that he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf. One day a chocolate-ration was issued. There had been no such issue for weeks or months past. He remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce slab (they still talked about ounces in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he were listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. His mother told him not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging argument that went round and round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In the end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston, giving the other quarter to his sister.

At irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill, but he had the impression that they always undercharged him. It would have made no difference if it had been the other way about. He had always plenty of money nowadays. He even had a job, a sinecure, more highly-paid than his old job had been. The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. Winston raised his head to listen. No bulletins from the front, however. It was merely a brief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter, it appeared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan\'s quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by 98 per cent. He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights. \'White to play and mate in two moves.\' Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm power. White always mates. The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone: \'You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty Fifteenthirty!

A bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall. There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But he was also hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know, probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed. He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed on his knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made unexpected movements they yelled at you from the telescreen.

The landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women\'s hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees. The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside.

He might have silenced the darkhaired girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one\'s own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same, he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.

It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre. The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place, after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted. However  ! Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving of St Clement Danes, take it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls. He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington\'s memory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again.

But the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier. The story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped out once and for all. By 1970 none of them was left, except Big Brother himself. All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counter-revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes. Among the last survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three had been arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way. They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important.

O\'Brien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It aroused in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding — a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen from the top the stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby. It had a sour-sweet smell.

Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons. Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark- coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow\'s breakfast.

Elle était grande, sculpturale, plutôt\nsilencieuse, avec de lents mouvements et une magnifique chevelure blonde. Le\nsouvenir qu’il avait de son père était plus vague. C’était un homme brun et\nmince, toujours vêtu de costumes sombres et nets, qui portait des lunettes.\n(Winston se rappelait surtout les minces semelles des chaussures de son père.)\nTous deux avaient probablement été engloutis dans l’une des premières grandes\népurations des années 50.\nSa mère, dans ce rêve, était assise\nen quelque lieu profond au-dessous de Winston, avec, dans ses bras, la jeune\nsœur de celui-ci. Il ne se souvenait pas du tout de sa sœur, sauf que c’était\nun bébé petit, faible, toujours silencieux, aux grands yeux attentifs. Toutes\nles deux le regardaient. Elles étaient dans un endroit souterrain – le fond\nd’un puits, par exemple, ou une tombe très profonde – mais c’était un endroit\nqui, bien que déjà très bas, continuait à descendre. Elles se trouvaient dans\nle salon d’un bateau qui sombrait et le regardaient à travers l’eau de plus en\nplus opaque. Il y avait de l’air dans le salon, ils pouvaient encore se voir\nles uns les autres, mais elles s’enfonçaient de plus en plus dans l’eau verte\nqui bientôt les cacherait pour jamais. Il était dehors, dans l’air et la\nlumière tandis qu’elles étaient aspirées vers la mort. Et elles étaient là parce\nque lui était en haut.\nIl le savait et il pouvait voir sur leurs\nvisages qu’elles le savaient. Il n’y avait de reproche ni sur leurs visages, ni\ndans leurs cœurs. Il y avait seulement la certitude qu’elles devaient mourir\npour qu’il vive et que cela faisait partie de l’ordre inévitable des choses.\nIl ne pouvait se souvenir de ce qui\nétait arrivé, mais il savait dans son rêve que les vies de sa mère et de sa\nsœur avaient été sacrifiées à la sienne. C’était un de ces rêves qui, tout en\noffrant le décor caractéristique du rêve, permettent et prolongent l’activité\nde l’intelligence. Au cours de tels rêves, on prend conscience de faits et\nd’idées qui gardent leur valeur quand on s’est réveillé. Ce qui frappa soudain\nWinston, c’est que la mort de sa mère, survenue il y avait près de trente ans,\navait été d’un tragique et d’une tristesse qui seraient actuellement\nimpossibles. Il comprit que le tragique était un élément des temps anciens, des\ntemps où existaient encore l’intimité, l’amour et l’amitié, quand les membres\nd’une famille s’entraidaient sans se demander au nom de quoi. Le souvenir de sa\nmère le déchirait parce qu’elle était morte en l’aimant, alors qu’il était trop\njeune et trop égoïste pour l’aimer en retour. C’était aussi parce qu’elle\ns’était sacrifiée, il ne se rappelait plus comment, à une conception, personnelle\net inaltérable, de la loyauté. Il se rendait compte que de telles choses ne\npouvaient plus se produire. Aujourd’hui, il y avait de la peur, de la haine, de\nla souffrance, mais il n’y avait aucune dignité dans l’émotion. Il n’y avait\naucune profondeur, aucune complexité dans les tristesses. Il lui semblait voir\ntout cela dans les grands yeux de sa mère et de sa sœur qui, à des centaines de\nbrasses de profondeur, le regardaient à travers les eaux vertes et\ns’enfonçaient encore.\nIl se trouva soudain debout sur du\ngazon élastique, par un soir d’été, alors que les rayons obliques du soleil\ndorent la terre. Le paysage qu’il regardait revenait si souvent dans ses rêves\nqu’il n’était jamais tout à fait sûr de ne pas l’avoir vu dans le monde réel.\nLorsque à son réveil il s’en souvenait, il l’appelait le Pays Doré. C’était un\nancien pâturage, dévoré par les lapins et que traversait un sentier sinueux.\nDes taupinières l’accidentaient çà et là. Dans la haie mal taillée qui se\ntrouvait de l’autre côté du champ, des branches d’ormes se balançaient\ndoucement dans la brise et leurs feuilles se déplaçaient par masses épaisses\ncomme des chevelures de femmes. Quelque part, tout près, bien que caché au\nregard, il y avait un ruisseau lent et clair. Il formait, sous les saules, des\nétangs dans lesquels nageaient des poissons dorés.\nLa fille aux cheveux noirs se\ndirigeait vers Winston à travers le champ. D’un seul geste, lui sembla-t-il,\nelle déchira ses vêtements et les rejeta dédaigneusement. Son corps était blanc\net lisse, mais il n’éveilla aucun désir chez Winston, qui le regarda à peine.\nCe qui en cet instant le transportait d’admiration, c’était le geste avec\nlequel elle avait rejeté ses vêtements. La grâce négligente de ce geste\nsemblait anéantir toute une culture, tout un système de pensées, comme si Big\nBrother, le Parti, la Police de la Pensée, pouvaient être rejetés au néant par\nun unique et splendide mouvement du bras. Cela aussi était un geste de l’ancien\ntemps.\nWinston se réveilla avec sur les\nlèvres le mot « Shakespeare ».\nLe télécran émettait un coup de\nsifflet assourdissant sur une note unique qui dura trente secondes. Il était\nsept heures un quart, heure du lever des employés de bureau. Winston s’arracha\ndu lit. Il était nu, car les membres du Parti Extérieur ne recevaient\nannuellement que trois mille points textiles, et il en fallait six cents pour\nun pyjama. Il attrapa sur une chaise un médiocre gilet de flanelle et un short.\nL’heure de culture physique allait commencer dans trois minutes. Une violente\nquinte de toux, qui presque toujours le prenait tout de suite après son réveil,\nl’obligea à se plier en deux. L’air lui manquait à tel point qu’il ne put\nreprendre son souffle qu’après une série de profondes inspirations, couché sur\nle dos. Ses veines s’étaient gonflées dans l’effort qu’il avait fait pour\ntousser et son ulcère variqueux commençait à le démanger.\n— Groupe trente à\nquarante ! glapit une voix perçante de femme.

It would always exist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up. In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, \'just to keep people frightened\'. This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him. She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, having learnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his own schooldays, Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later, when Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long before the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting.

The women studied him in hostile silence as he went past. But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had definite business there. The patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them. \'May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What time did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?\' — and so on and so forth. Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it. Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warning from all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back again, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to the sky. \'Steamer!\' he yelled. \'Look out, guv\'nor! Bang over\'ead!

The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles from bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age of six. But simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. In reality very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary to know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party.

It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forcedlabour camp: not more, if you had committed no other offence. And it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves. Some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink. Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class. The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members. But — though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to — it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening. The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All marriages between Party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose, and — though the principle was never clearly stated — permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another.

But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him. The other person was a man named O\'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching. O\'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming — in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winston had seen O\'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between O\'Brien\'s urbane manner and his prize-fighter\'s physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief— or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope — that O\'Brien\'s political orthodoxy was not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('3ea464d7-e96f-47bf-8d61-119ba663aea2','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',211,'human, what difference did it ultimately make?

A passing waiter noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle. He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank. But it had become the element he swam in. It was his life, his death, and his resurrection. It was gin that sank him into stupor every night, and gin that revived him every morning. When he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, with gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight. Through the midday hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, listening to the telescreen. From fifteen to closing-time he was a fixture in the Chestnut Tree. No one cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him, no telescreen admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he went to a dusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of Truth and did a little work, or what was called work. He had been appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They were engaged in producing something called an Interim Report, but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out.

The person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to speaking. Winston stopped abruptly and turned. It was O\'Brien. At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away. His heart bounded violently. He would have been incapable of speaking. O\'Brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement, laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston\'s arm, so that the two of them were walking side by side. He began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members. \'I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,\' he said. \'I was reading one of your Newspeak articles in \'The Times\' the other day.

The tradition — the unspoken tradition: somehow you knew it, though you never heard it said — was that they shot you from behind; always in the back of the head, without warning, as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell.

He was walking down the corridor, waiting for the bullet. He knew that it was coming in another moment. Everything was settled, smoothed out, reconciled. There were no more doubts, no more arguments, no more pain, no more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily, with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love, he was in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometre wide, down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs. He was in the Golden Country, following the foottrack across the old rabbit- cropped pasture. He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees, faintly stirring, and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willows.

Your mind is in the same state. I do not think there can be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged and insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you?\' Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes. He looked up at O\'Brien. \'I have not betrayed Julia,\' he said. O\'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. \'No,\' he said; \'no; that is perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.\' The peculiar reverence for O\'Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy, flooded Winston\'s heart again. How intelligent, he thought, how intelligent! Never did O\'Brien fail to understand what was said to him. Anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he HAD betrayed Julia. For what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture? He had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, her character, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings, all that he had said to her 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('421f3db2-298b-41cc-b948-5d5b52f46d0f','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',270,'has done so. The trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique. It is learned by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, \'reality control\'. In Newspeak it is called DOUBLETHINK, though DOUBLETHINK comprises much else as well. DOUBLETHINK means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one\'s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of DOUBLETHINK he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. DOUBLETHINK lies at the very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies — all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word DOUBLETHINK it is necessary to exercise DOUBLETHINK. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of DOUBLETHINK one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('437bb28b-0b8b-41a4-b44c-ec885691bbea','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',143,'\'Victory Square, near the monument.\' \'It\'s full of telescreens.\' \'It doesn\'t matter if there\'s a crowd.\' \'Any signal?\' \'No. Don\'t come up to me until you see me among a lot of people.

They did not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another. The girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to smoke a cigarette. Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. He wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which Big Brother\'s statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell. At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared. Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she had changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of pale- coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin\'s Church, whose bells, when it  143','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('442bf4e8-1385-47a1-952f-cbaa6af9839f','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',33,'The voice from the telescreen paused.

Our forces in South India have won a glorious victory. I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end. Here is the newsflash — Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough, following on a gory description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week, the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty. Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling. The telescreen — perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate — crashed into \'Oceania, \'tis for thee\'. You were supposed to stand to attention. However, in his present position he was invisible. \'Oceania, \'tis for thee\' gave way to lighter music. Winston walked over to the window, keeping his back to the telescreen.

He had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemed to make no difference, except that one\'s dreams were more coherent. He dreamed a great deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. He was in the Golden Country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious, sunlit ruins, with his mother, with Julia, with O\'Brien — not doing anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. Such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. He seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the stimulus of pain had been removed. He was not bored, he had no desire for conversation or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was completely satisfying. By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body. He would finger himself here and there, trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter.

Somewhat absentmindedly O\'Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered notebook and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore out the page and handed it to Winston. \'I am usually at home in the evenings,\' he said. \'If not, my servant will give you the dictionary\' He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, which this time there was no need to conceal.

In spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. It came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipulated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. However much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease, amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage. \'This is unavoidable,\' his voice seemed to say; \'this is what we have got to do, unflinchingly. But this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again.\' A wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out from Winston towards O\'Brien. For the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of Goldstein. When you looked at O\'Brien\'s powerful shoulders and his blunt- featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to believe that he could be defeated.

But, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet. He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him. A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside. \'Oh, comrade,\' she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, \'I thought I heard you come in.

His voice had grown stern again. \'Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completely you surrender to us. No one who has once gone astray is ever spared.

Winston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head.

The problem is the same for all three superstates. It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs. Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states are very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common 248 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('46af7196-9a9c-4b2d-8ed4-66b7a2753270','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',104,'Chapter 8 From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee — real coffee, not Victory Coffee — came floating out into the street. Winston paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound. He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer was throbbing. This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked. In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except in bed. It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak: OWNLIFE, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But this evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable.

A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline. The first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to young children, is called, in Newspeak, CRIMESTOP CRIMESTOP means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. CRIMESTOP, in short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one\'s own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts.

Winston s’arrêta involontairement. Il retrouva,\npeut-être deux secondes, le monde à moitié oublié de son enfance. Puis une\nporte claqua, qui sembla couper l’odeur aussi brusquement que s’il s’agissait\nd’un son.\nIl avait, pendant plusieurs\nkilomètres, marché sur des pavés, et son ulcère variqueux lui donnait des\nélancements. C’était la seconde fois, en trois semaines, qu’il manquait une\nsoirée au Centre communautaire. C’était une grave imprudence, car on pouvait\nêtre certain que les présences au Centre étaient soigneusement contrôlées.\nEn principe, un membre du Parti\nn’avait pas de loisirs et n’était jamais seul, sauf quand il était au lit. On\ntenait pour acquis que lorsqu’il ne travaillait, ne mangeait ou ne dormait pas,\nil prenait part à quelque distraction collective. Faire n’importe quoi qui\npourrait indiquer un goût pour la solitude, ne fût-ce qu’une promenade, était\ntoujours légèrement dangereux. Il y avait, en novlangue, un mot pour désigner\nce goût. C’était egovie, qui signifiait individualisme et excentricité. Mais ce\nsoir-là, quand il était sorti du ministère, le parfum de l’air d’avril l’avait\ntenté. Le ciel était d’un bleu plus chaud qu’il ne l’avait encore été de\nl’année et, soudain, la longue soirée bruyante au Centre, les jeux assommants\net fatigants, les conférences, la camaraderie criarde, facilitée par le gin,\nlui avaient paru intolérables. D’un mouvement impulsif, il s’était détourné de\nl’arrêt de l’autobus et avait erré dans le labyrinthe londonien, d’abord au\nSud, puis à l’Est, puis au Nord. Il s’était égaré dans des rues inconnues, se\npréoccupant à peine de la direction qu’il prenait.\nS’il y a un espoir, avait-il\nécrit dans son journal, il est chez les prolétaires.\nCes mots, affirmation d’une vérité\nmystique, mais d’une palpable absurdité, le hantèrent pendant sa promenade. Il\nse trouvait quelque part dans les quartiers sordides et vagues, peints de brun,\nvers le Nord-Est de ce qui, à une époque, avait été la gare de Saint-Pancrace.\nIl remontait une rue grossièrement pavée, bordée de petites maisons à deux\nétages dont les portes délabrées ouvraient directement sur le trottoir et\ndonnaient curieusement l’impression de trous de rats. Il y avait çà et là, au\nmilieu des pavés, des flaques d’eau sale. À l’intérieur et à l’extérieur des\nporches sombres et le long d’étroites ruelles latérales qui s’ouvraient de\nchaque côté de l’artère principale un nombre étonnant de gens\nfourmillaient : filles en pleine floraison, aux lèvres violemment rougies,\ngarçons qui poursuivaient les filles, femmes enflées à la démarche lourde, images\nde ce que seraient les filles dans dix ans, créatures vieilles et courbées\ntraînant des pieds plats, enfants pieds nus et haillonneux qui jouaient dans\nles flaques d’eau et s’égaillaient aux cris furieux de leur mère. Un quart\npeut-être des fenêtres de la rue était réparé au moyen de planches. La plupart\ndes gens ne faisaient pas attention à Winston. Quelques-uns le regardaient avec\nune sorte de curiosité circonspecte. Deux femmes monstrueuses, aux avant-bras\nd’un rouge brique croisés sur leur tablier, bavardaient devant une porte.\nWinston saisit en passant des bribes de conversation.\n— Oui, que je lui ai dit, tout\nça c’est très bien, oui, mais à ma place, vous auriez fait comme moi. C’est\nfacile de critiquer, je lui ai dit, mais vous n’avez pas les mêmes ennuis que\nmoi.\n— Ah ! répondait l’autre,\nc’est tout juste comme vous dites, c’est là que ça cloche.\nLes voix stridentes s’arrêtèrent\nbrusquement. Les femmes l’examinèrent au passage dans un silence hostile. Ce\nn’était pas exactement de l’hostilité. C’était plutôt une sorte de\ncirconspection, de raidissement momentané, comme au passage d’un animal non\nfamilier. On ne devait pas voir souvent, dans une telle rue, la combinaison\nbleue du Parti.\nIl était en vérité imprudent de se\nmontrer dans de tels lieux à moins que l’on y fût appelé par une affaire\nprécise. On pouvait être arrêté par des patrouilles. « Puis-je voir vos\npapiers, camarade ? Que faites-vous là ? À quelle heure avez-vous\nlaissé votre travail ? Est-ce votre chemin habituel pour rentrer chez vous ? »\nEt ainsi de suite. Non qu’il y eût aucune règle interdisant de rentrer chez soi\npar un chemin inhabituel, mais cela suffisait pour attirer sur vous\nl’attention, si la Police de la Pensée était prévenue.\nBrusquement, toute la rue fut en\nébullition. Le cri de sauve-qui-peut fusa de tous côtés. Les gens filaient chez\neux comme des lapins. Une jeune femme jaillit d’une porte, s’empara d’un petit\nenfant qui jouait dans une flaque, l’enveloppa vivement de son tablier et\nrentra chez elle d’un bond.\nAu même instant, un homme vêtu d’un\nhabit noir en accordéon, qui avait surgi d’une rue transversale, courut à\nWinston et, d’un air bouleversé, lui montra du doigt le ciel.\n— Marmites ! hurla-t-il.\nAttention, patron ! patron ! Pan ! sur la tête. À plat\nventre ! Vite !\n« Marmites » était le nom\ndonné, on ne savait pourquoi, par les prolétaires, aux bombes-fusées. Winston\nse jeta promptement sur le sol. Les prolétaires ne se trompaient presque jamais\nquand ils vous donnaient de tels avis. Ils semblaient posséder une sorte\nd’instinct qui les prévenait plusieurs secondes à l’avance de l’approche d’une\nfusée, bien que celle-ci soit censée voyager plus vite que le son. Winston se\ncouvrit la tête de ses bras repliés. On entendit un grondement sourd qui sembla\nsoulever le pavé. Une pluie d’objets légers lui tombèrent en grêle sur le dos.\nQuand il se releva, il vit qu’il avait été couvert de fragments de vitre tombés\nd’une fenêtre voisine.\nIl reprit sa marche. La bombe avait\ndémoli un groupe de maisons à deux cents mètres dans le haut de la rue. Une\ncolonne de fumée noire pendait du ciel et, au-dessous, il y avait un nuage de\npoussière de plâtre dans lequel, autour des décombres, une foule se groupait\ndéjà.','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('47a88d7c-145d-43d4-a430-7c682001bb66','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',293,'keep still. Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour — it was difficult to judge. Once more there was a sound of boots outside. Winston\'s entrails contracted. Soon, very soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had come. The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell. With a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth. \'Room 101,\' he said. Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguely perturbed, but uncomprehending. What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston\'s belly had revived. His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six thoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming; O\'Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm in his entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door opened, the wave of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. Parsons walked into the cell. He was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt. This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness. \'YOU here!\' he said. Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor surprise, but only misery. He began walking jerkily up and down, evidently unable to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that they were trembling.

If he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work, he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By a routine that was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few people ever wrote letters. For the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did not know the girl\'s name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by herself, somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round — if these conditions endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few words.

The little sandy-haired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous murmur that sounded like \'My Saviour!\' she extended her arms towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer. At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of \'B-BL.B-B!\' — over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first \'B\' and the second — a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tomtoms. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.

He must speak to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. It was even conceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade. Ampleforth,\' he said.

He had heard himself cry aloud: \'Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!\' For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence. She had seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him. It was as though she had got into the texture of his skin. In that moment he had loved her far more than he had ever done when they were together and free. Also he knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help. He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. What had he done? How many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness? In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside. They could not let such an outburst go unpunished. They would know now, if they had not known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them. He obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he had retreated a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped to keep the inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, but he preferred to be in the wrong. They would understand that — O\'Brien would understand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish cry. He would have to start all over again. It might take years. He ran a hand over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. There were deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose flattened.

Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledgehammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one\'s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston\'s hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization. It was even possible, at moments, to switch one\'s hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one\'s head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to ','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('4df442d7-dd75-42bc-af25-8e06ba6112cf','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',173,'and spoke in generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. And when they had such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so, added that there were two entries to the house, one of them through the back yard, which gave on an alley. Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped out, secure in the protection of the muslin curtain. The June sun was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle, was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line, pegging out a series of square white things which Winston recognized as babies\' diapers.

The eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man, then turning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction. Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up, waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the skull-faced man. There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. The chinless man jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands behind his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift. \'Bumstead!\' roared the voice. \'2713 Bumstead J.!

As the young officer entered and stepped aside, there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man, and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, with all the weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man\'s mouth.

Winston wrenched his body out of bed — naked, for a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually, and a suit of pyjamas was 600 — and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching. \'Thirty to forty group!\' yapped a piercing female voice. \'Thirty to forty group! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!\' Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym-shoes, had already appeared. \'Arms bending and stretching!\' she rapped out. \'Take your time by me. ONE, two, three, four! ONE, two, three, four! Come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it! ONE, two, three four! ONE two, three, four!...\' The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winston\'s mind the impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat.

When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love. It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one\'s consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened. At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia burst into the room. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, partly because she was still holding the tool-bag. \'Half a second,\' she said. \'Just let me show you what I\'ve brought. Did you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee? I thought you would. You can chuck it away again, because we shan\'t be needing it. Look here.\' She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. Underneath were a number of neat paper packets. The first packet that she passed to Winston had a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of heavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it. \'It isn\'t sugar?\' he said. 176 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('501581cd-91e3-4fea-a034-4c67d0794b88','2024-04-05 05:06:49','2024-04-05 05:06:49','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',13,'un coin de la couverture.

À droite du phonoscript se trouvait un petit tube pneumatique\npour les messages écrits. À gauche, il y avait un tube plus large pour les\njournaux. Dans le mur de côté, à portée de la main de Winston, il y avait une\nlarge fente ovale protégée par un grillage métallique. On se servait de cette\nfente pour jeter les vieux papiers. Il y avait des milliers et des milliers de\nfentes semblables dans l’édifice. Il s’en trouvait, non seulement dans chaque\npièce mais, à de courts intervalles, dans chaque couloir. On les surnommait\ntrous de mémoire. Lorsqu’un document devait être détruit, ou qu’on apercevait\nle moindre bout de papier qui traînait, on soulevait le clapet du plus proche\ntrou de mémoire, l’action était automatique, et on laissait tomber le papier,\nlequel était rapidement emporté par un courant d’air chaud jusqu’aux énormes\nfournaises cachées quelque part dans les profondeurs de l’édifice.\nWinston examina les quatre bouts de\npapier qu’il avait déroulés. Ils contenaient chacun un message d’une ou deux\nlignes seulement, dans le jargon abrégé employé au ministère pour le service\nintérieur. Ce n’était pas exactement du novlangue, mais il comprenait un grand\nnombre de mots novlangue. Ces messages étaient ainsi rédigés :\ntimes 17-3-84 discours malreporté\nafrique rectifier\ntimes 19-12-83 prévisions 3 ap 4e\ntrimestre 83 erreurs typo vérifier numéro de ce jour.\ntimes 14-2-84 miniplein chocolat\nmalcoté rectifier\ntimes 3-12-83 report ordrejour bb\ntrèsmauvais ref unpersonnes récrire entier soumettrehaut anteclassement.\nAvec un léger soupir de\nsatisfaction, Winston mit de côté le quatrième message. C’était un travail\ncompliqué qui comportait des responsabilités et qu’il valait mieux entreprendre\nen dernier lieu. Les trois autres ne demandaient que de la routine, quoique le\nsecond impliquât probablement une fastidieuse étude de listes de chiffres.\nWinston composa sur le télécran les\nmots : « numéros anciens » et demanda les numéros du journal le Times\nqui lui étaient nécessaires. Quelques minutes seulement plus tard, ils glissaient\ndu tube pneumatique. Les messages qu’il avait reçus se rapportaient à des\narticles, ou à des passages d’articles que, pour une raison ou pour une autre,\non pensait nécessaire de modifier ou, plutôt, suivant le terme officiel, de\nrectifier.\nPar exemple, dans le Times du\n17 mars, il apparaissait que Big Brother dans son discours de la veille,\navait prédit que le front de l’Inde du Sud resterait calme. L’offensive\neurasienne serait bientôt lancée contre l’Afrique du Nord. Or, le haut\ncommandement eurasien avait lancé son offensive contre l’Inde du Sud et ne\ns’était pas occupé de l’Afrique du Nord. Il était donc nécessaire de réécrire\nle paragraphe erroné du discours de Big Brother afin qu’il prédise ce qui était\nréellement arrivé.\nDe même, le Times du\n19 décembre avait publié les prévisions officielles pour la production de\ndifférentes sortes de marchandises de consommation au cours du quatrième\ntrimestre 1983 qui était en même temps le sixième trimestre du neuvième plan\ntriennal. Le journal du jour publiait un état de la production réelle. Il en\nressortait que les prévisions avaient été, dans tous les cas, grossièrement\nerronées. Le travail de Winston était de rectifier les chiffres primitifs pour\nles faire concorder avec les derniers parus.\nQuant au troisième message, il se\nrapportait à une simple erreur qui pouvait être corrigée en deux minutes. Il\nn’y avait pas très longtemps, c’était au mois de février, le ministère de\nl’Abondance avait publié la promesse (en termes officiels, l’engagement\ncatégorique) de ne pas réduire la ration de chocolat durant l’année 1984.\nOr, la ration, comme le savait Winston, devait être réduite de trente à vingt\ngrammes à partir de la fin de la semaine. Tout ce qu’il y avait à faire,\nc’était de substituer à la promesse primitive l’avis qu’il serait probablement\nnécessaire de réduire la ration de chocolat dans le courant du mois d’avril.\nDès qu’il avait fini de s’occuper de\nl’un des messages, Winston agrafait ses corrections phonoscriptées au numéro\ncorrespondant du Times et les introduisait dans le tube pneumatique.\nEnsuite, d’un geste autant que possible inconscient, il chiffonnait le message\net les notes qu’il avait lui-même faites et les jetait dans le trou de mémoire\nafin que le tout fût dévoré par les flammes.\nQue se passait-il dans le labyrinthe\noù conduisaient les pneumatiques ? Winston ne le savait pas en détail,\nmais il en connaissait les grandes lignes. Lorsque toutes les corrections qu’il\nétait nécessaire d’apporter à un numéro spécial du Times avaient été\nrassemblées et collationnées, le numéro était réimprimé. La copie originale\nétait détruite et remplacée dans la collection par la copie corrigée.\nCe processus de continuelles\nretouches était appliqué, non seulement aux journaux, mais aux livres,\npériodiques, pamphlets, affiches, prospectus, films, enregistrements sonores,\ncaricatures, photographies. Il était appliqué à tous les genres imaginables de\nlittérature ou de documentation qui pouvaient comporter quelque signification\npolitique ou idéologique. Jour par jour, et presque minute par minute, le passé\nétait mis à jour. On pouvait ainsi prouver, avec documents à l’appui, que les\nprédictions faites par le Parti s’étaient trouvées vérifiées. Aucune opinion,\naucune information ne restait consignée, qui aurait pu se trouver en conflit\navec les besoins du moment.

Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party. Its numbers limited to six millions, or something less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania. Below the Inner Party comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is described as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the hands. Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as \'the proles\', numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population. In the terms of our earlier classification, the proles are the Low: for the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror, are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure. In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary. The child of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party. Admission to either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen. Nor is there any racial discrimination, or any marked domination of one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans of pure Indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the Party, and the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area. In no part of Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Oceania has no capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows. Except that English is its chief LINGUA FRANCA and Newspeak its official language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers are not held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It is true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines.  263','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('51b88f50-3746-41ee-9618-400083b68add','2024-04-05 05:06:49','2024-04-05 05:06:49','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',15,'\nWinston se mit rapidement au\ngarde-à-vous en face du télécran sur lequel venait d’apparaître l’image d’une\nfemme assez jeune, fine, mais musclée, vêtue d’une tunique et chaussée de\nsandales de gymnastique.\n— Flexion et extension des\nbras ! lança-t-elle.

Un, deux,\ntrois quatre !…\nLa souffrance causée par sa quinte\nn’avait pas tout à fait effacé de l’esprit de Winston l’impression faite par\nson rêve, et les mouvements rythmés de l’exercice la ravivèrent. Tandis qu’il\nlançait mécaniquement ses bras en arrière et en avant et maintenait sur son\nvisage l’expression de satisfaction et de sérieux que l’on considérait comme\nnormale pendant la culture physique, il luttait pour retourner mentalement à la\npériode imprécise de sa petite enfance. C’était extrêmement difficile. Au-delà\ndes dernières années 50, tout se décolorait. Lorsque quelqu’un n’a pas de\npoints de repère extérieurs à quoi se référer, le tracé même de sa propre vie\nperd de sa netteté. Il se souvient d’événements importants qui n’ont\nprobablement pas eu lieu, il retrouve le détail d’incidents dont il ne peut\nrecréer l’atmosphère, et il y a de longues périodes vides à quoi rien ne se rapporte.\nTout était alors différent. Même les noms des pays et leur forme sur la carte\nétaient différents. La Première Région Aérienne, par exemple, était appelée\nautrement dans ce temps-là. On l’appelait Angleterre, ou Grande-Bretagne. Mais\nla ville de Londres, il en était sûr, avait toujours été nommée Londres.\nWinston ne pouvait se souvenir avec\nprécision d’une époque pendant laquelle son pays n’avait pas été en guerre. Il\nétait évident cependant que, durant son enfance, il y avait eu un assez long\nintervalle de paix. Un de ses plus anciens souvenirs, en effet, était celui\nd’un raid aérien qui avait paru surprendre tout le monde. Peut-être était-ce à\nl’époque où la bombe atomique était tombée sur Colchester. Il ne se souvenait\npas du raid lui-même, mais il se rappelait l’étreinte sur la sienne de la main\nde son père, tandis qu’ils dégringolaient toujours plus bas, vers le centre de\nla terre, un escalier sonore en spirale qui fuyait sous leurs pieds et lui\nfatigua tellement les jambes qu’il se mit à pleurnicher. Ils durent s’arrêter\npour se reposer. Sa mère, à sa manière lente et rêveuse, les suivait très loin\nen arrière. Elle portait la petite sœur, ou peut-être était-ce seulement un\npaquet de couvertures ? Winston n’était pas certain que sa sœur fût déjà\nnée. Ils émergèrent à la fin dans un endroit bruyant et bondé de gens. C’était,\nil le comprit, une station de métro.\nPartout, sur le sol dallé, il y\navait des gens assis. D’autres se pressaient les uns contre les autres sur des\nbanquettes de métal. Winston, son père et sa mère trouvèrent une place sur le\nsol. Près d’eux, deux vieillards étaient assis côte à côte sur une couchette.\nL’homme était décemment vêtu d’un costume sombre. Une casquette de drap, noire,\nrepoussée en arrière, découvrait ses cheveux très blancs. Son visage était\nécarlate, ses yeux étaient bleus et pleins de larmes. Il sentait le gin à plein\nnez. L’odeur semblait sourdre de sa peau à la place de la sueur et l’on pouvait\nimaginer que les larmes qui jaillissaient de ses yeux étaient du gin pur. Mais,\nbien que légèrement ivre, il était sous le coup d’un chagrin sincère et\nintolérable. Winston, d’une manière enfantine, comprit qu’un événement\nterrible, un événement impardonnable et pour lequel il n’y avait pas de remède,\nvenait de se passer. Il lui sembla aussi qu’il savait ce que c’était. Quelqu’un\nque le vieillard aimait, une petite fille peut-être, avait été tué. Le\nvieillard répétait toutes les deux minutes : « Nous n’aurions pas dû\nleur faire confiance. Je l’avais dit, maman, n’est-ce pas ? C’est ce qui\narrive quand on leur fait confiance. Je l’ai toujours dit. Nous n’aurions pas\ndû faire confiance à ces types. »\nMais à quels types ils n’auraient\npas dû se fier, Winston ne s’en souvenait plus.\nÀ partir de ce moment, la guerre,\npour ainsi dire, n’avait jamais cessé, mais, à proprement parler, ce n’était\npas toujours la même guerre. Pendant plusieurs mois de l’enfance de Winston, il\ny avait eu des combats de rue confus dans Londres même, et il se souvenait avec\nprécision de quelques-uns d’entre eux. Mais retrouver l’histoire de toute la\npériode, dire qui combattait contre qui à un moment donné était absolument\nimpossible.

When any large operation is undertaken, it is usually a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all three powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following, is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible. It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining worldpower, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization. Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the Equator and the Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken. This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, followed on all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimi','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('51ede073-6709-4633-95ec-9d5572bfc94e','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',305,'eriods of recovery.

He remembered a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. He remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep. The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory. His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted — he thought, he could not be sure — ten or twelve hours at a stretch. These other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning.

Late at night, when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. The rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which there were wild rumours. The new tune which was to be the theme-song of Hate Week (the Hate Song, it was called) had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens. It had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly be called music, but resembled the beating of a drum. Roared out by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. The proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets it competed with the still-popular \'It was only a hopeless fancy\'. The Parsons children played it at all hours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and a piece of toilet paper. Winston\'s evenings were fuller than ever. Squads of volunteers, organized by Parsons, were preparing the street for Hate Week, stitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaff\'s on the roofs, and perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers. Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display four hundred metres of bunting. He was in his native element and as happy as a lark.

Then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the two halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth. The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. The chinless man climbed back into his place. Down one side of his face the flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry- coloured mass with a black hole in the middle of it. From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls. His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever, as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliation. The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indicated the skull-faced man. \'Room 101,\' he said. There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston\'s side.

He seemed glad of the opportunity to talk. Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had always vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman. With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that — a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken snuffbox, a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby\'s hair — never asking that Winston should buy it, merely that he should admire it. To talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musicalbox. He had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes. There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death of poor Cock Robin. \'It just occurred to me you might be interested,\' he would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment. But he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme. Both of them knew — in a way, it was never out of their minds that what was now happening could not last long.

But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford\'s ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the first time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing AT WHAT he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses. A little later all three were re- arrested. It appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. At their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded in the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance. It was a half-page torn out of \'The Times\' of about ten years earlier — the top half of the page, so that it included the date — and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominent in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom.

His mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing. It must have been about a month before she disappeared. It was a moment of reconciliation, when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived. He remembered the day well, a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the window-pane and the light indoors was too dull to read by. The boredom of the two children in the dark, cramped bedroom became unbearable. Winston whined and grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room pulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently. In the end his mother said, \'Now be good, and I\'ll buy you a toy. A lovely toy — you\'ll love it\'; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a little general shop which was still sporadically open nearby, and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and Ladders. He could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. The board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill- cut that they would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at the thing sulkily and without interest. But then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play. Soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again, almost to the startingpoint.

For only an instant it was before his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it. \'It exists!\' he cried. \'No,\' said O\'Brien. He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall. O\'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.

The pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. He began to write down the thoughts that came into his head. He wrote first in large clumsy capitals: FREEDOM IS SLAVERY Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it: TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE But then there came a sort of check. His mind, as though shying away from something, seemed unable to concentrate. He knew that he knew what came next, but for the moment he could not recall it.

Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face. O\'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic syringe. Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually. He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long he had been down there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were not continuous. There had been times when consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds, there was no way of knowing. With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. Later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long range of crimes — espionage, sabotage, and the like — to which everyone had to confess as a matter of course.

Girls are always supposed to be so pure. Here\'s one who isn\'t, anyway. She had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, with a Party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. \'And a good job too,\' said Julia, \'otherwise they\'d have had my name out of him when he confessed.\' Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw it was quite simple. You wanted a good time; \'they\', meaning the Party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. She seemed to think it just as natural that \'they\' should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. She hated the Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general criticism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never used Newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use. She had never heard of the Brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence. Any kind of organized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure, struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same.

The date had stuck in Winston\'s memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies. Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory. It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known. He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen. He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear that some accident — a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for instance — would betray him.

O\'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. \'In the place where there is no darkness,\' he said, as though he had recognized the allusion. \'And in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave? Any message? Any question?.\' Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding generalities. Instead of anything directly connected with O\'Brien or the Brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little room over Mr Charrington\'s shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame. Almost at random he said: \'Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins \'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement\'s\'?\' Again O\'Brien nodded.

Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears. In the end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and fists of the guards. He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the bullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of eminent Party members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as 1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife was still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known.

Voici le télégramme…\n« Cela présage une mauvaise\nnouvelle », pensa Winston. En effet, après une description réaliste de\nl’anéantissement de l’armée eurasienne et la proclamation du nombre stupéfiant\nde tués et de prisonniers, la voix annonça qu’à partir de la semaine suivante,\nla ration de chocolat serait réduite de trente à vingt grammes.\nWinston éructa encore.

Le télécran, peut-être\npour célébrer la victoire, peut-être pour noyer le souvenir du chocolat perdu,\nse lança dans le chant : Océania, c’est pour toi ! On était\ncensé être au garde-à-vous. Mais là où il se tenait, Winston était invisible.\nOcéania, c’est pour toi ! fit place à une musique plus légère. Winston alla à la fenêtre, le dos\nau télécran. C’était une journée encore froide et claire. Quelque part, au\nloin, une bombe explosa avec un grondement sourd qui se répercuta. Il y avait\nchaque semaine environ vingt ou trente de ces bombes qui tombaient sur Londres.\nDans la rue, le vent faisait claquer\nde droite à gauche l’affiche déchirée et le mot ANGSOC apparaissait et\ndisparaissait tour à tour. Angsoc. Les principes sacrés de l’Angsoc. Novlangue,\ndouble-pensée, mutabilité du passé. Winston avait l’impression d’errer dans les\nforêts des profondeurs sous-marines, perdu dans un monde monstrueux dont il\nétait lui-même le monstre. Il était seul. Le passé était mort, le futur inimaginable.\nQuelle certitude avait-il qu’une seule des créatures humaines actuellement\nvivantes pensait comme lui ? Et comment savoir si la souveraineté du Parti\nne durerait pas éternellement ? Comme une réponse, les trois slogans\ninscrits sur la façade blanche du ministère de la Vérité lui revinrent à\nl’esprit.\n \nLA GUERRE C’EST LA PAIX\nLA LIBERTÉ C’EST L’ESCLAVAGE\nL’IGNORANCE C’EST LA FORCE\n \nIl prit dans sa poche une pièce de\nvingt-cinq cents. Là aussi, en lettres minuscules et distinctes, les mêmes\nslogans étaient gravés. Sur l’autre face de la pièce, il y avait la tête de Big\nBrother dont les yeux, même là, vous poursuivaient. Sur les pièces de monnaie,\nsur les timbres, sur les livres, sur les bannières, sur les affiches, sur les\npaquets de cigarettes, partout ! Toujours ces yeux qui vous observaient,\ncette voix qui vous enveloppait. Dans le sommeil ou la veille, au travail ou à\ntable, au-dedans ou au-dehors, au bain ou au lit, pas d’évasion. Vous ne\npossédiez rien, en dehors des quelques centimètres cubes de votre crâne.\nLe soleil avait tourné et les\nmyriades de fenêtres du ministère de la Vérité qui n’étaient plus éclairées par\nla lumière paraissaient sinistres comme les meurtrières d’une forteresse. Le\ncœur de Winston défaillit devant l’énorme construction pyramidale. Elle était\ntrop puissante, on ne pourrait la prendre d’assaut. Un millier de bombes ne\npourraient l’abattre.\nWinston se demanda de nouveau pour\nqui il écrivait son journal. Pour l’avenir ? Pour le passé ? Pour un\nâge qui pourrait n’être qu’imaginaire ? Il avait devant lui la\nperspective, non de la mort, mais de l’anéantissement. Son journal serait\nréduit en cendres et lui-même en vapeur. Seule, la Police de la Pensée lirait\nce qu’il aurait écrit avant de l’effacer de l’existence et de la mémoire.\nComment pourrait-on faire appel au futur alors que pas une trace, pas même un\nmot anonyme griffonné sur un bout de papier ne pouvait matériellement\nsurvivre ?\nLe télécran sonna quatorze heures.\nWinston devait partir dans dix minutes. Il lui fallait être à son travail à\nquatorze heures trente.\nCurieusement, le carillon de l’heure\nparut lui communiquer un courage nouveau. C’était un fantôme solitaire qui\nexprimait une vérité que personne n’entendrait jamais. Mais aussi longtemps\nqu’il l’exprimerait, la continuité, par quelque obscur processus, ne serait pas\nbrisée. Ce n’était pas en se faisant entendre, mais en conservant son équilibre\nque l’on portait plus loin l’héritage humain. Winston retourna à sa table,\ntrempa sa plume et écrivit :\nAu futur ou au passé, au temps où\nla pensée est libre, où les hommes sont dissemblables mais ne sont pas\nsolitaires, au temps où la vérité existe, où ce qui est fait ne peut être\ndéfait, de l’âge de l’uniformité, de l’âge de la solitude, de l’âge de Big\nBrocher, de l’âge de la double pensée, Salut !\nIl réfléchit qu’il était déjà mort.\nIl lui apparut que c’était seulement lorsqu’il avait commencé à être capable de\nformuler ses idées qu’il avait fait le pas décisif. Les conséquences d’un acte\nsont incluses dans l’acte lui-même. Il écrivit :\nLe crime de penser n’entraîne pas\nla mort. Le crime de penser est la mort.\nMaintenant qu’il s’était reconnu\ncomme mort, il devenait important de rester vivant aussi longtemps que\npossible. Deux doigts de sa main droite étaient tachés d’encre. C’était\nexactement le genre de détail qui pouvait vous trahir.

Winston alla dans la salle de bains et frotta soigneusement avec du\nsavon l’encre de son doigt. Ce savon, brun foncé, était granuleux et râpait la\npeau comme du papier émeri. Il convenait donc parfaitement.\nWinston rangea ensuite le journal\ndans son tiroir. Il était absolument inutile de chercher à le cacher, mais\nWinston pourrait au moins savoir s’il était découvert ou non. Un cheveu au\ntravers de l’extrémité des pages serait trop visible.

It was curious how that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the Party. The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth. \"The Ministry of Plenty\'s certainly done a good job this year,\' he said with a knowing shake of his head. \'By the way, Smith old boy, I suppose you haven\'t got any razor blades you can let me have?\' \'Not one,\' said Winston. \'I\'ve been using the same blade for six weeks myself \'Ah, well — just thought I\'d ask you, old boy\' \'Sorry\' said Winston. The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the Ministry\'s announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. For some reason Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years those children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O\'Brien would be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.

The guards, too, treated the common criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle them roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent. It was \'all right\' in the camps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes. There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes. The positions of trust were given only to the common criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals. There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description: drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes. Some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards, who had hold of her one at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across Winston\'s lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a yell of \'F  bastards!\' Then, noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off Winston\'s knees on to the bench.  287','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('61a87a99-730b-4d73-9333-e1a1cf9cfe97','2024-04-05 05:06:49','2024-04-05 05:06:49','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',39,'l’expression de visage d’une sœur morte depuis longtemps,\nles tourbillons de poussière par un matin de vent d’il y avait soixante-dix\nans, mais tous les faits importants étaient en dehors du champ de leur vision.\nIls étaient comme des fourmis.

Il s’arrêta et leva les yeux. Il se trouvait dans\nune rue étroite bordée de quelques petites boutiques sombres, disséminées parmi\ndes maisons d’habitation. Trois globes de métal décoloré, qui paraissaient\navoir dans le temps été dorés, étaient suspendus immédiatement au-dessus de sa\ntête. Il lui semblait reconnaître l’endroit. Naturellement ! Il se\ntrouvait devant le magasin d’antiquités où il avait acheté l’album. Un frisson\nde peur le traversa. Acheter l’album avait d’abord été un acte suffisamment\nimprudent, et il s’était juré de ne jamais revenir dans les environs du\nmagasin. Mais sitôt qu’il avait laissé vagabonder sa pensée, ses pieds l’avaient\nd’eux-mêmes ramené là. C’était précisément contre ces sortes d’impulsions qui\nétaient de véritables suicides, qu’il avait espéré se garder en écrivant son\njournal. Il remarqua au même instant que le magasin était encore ouvert, bien\nqu’il fût près de neuf heures. Avec l’impression qu’il serait moins remarqué à\nl’intérieur que s’il traînait sur le trottoir, il passa la porte. Si on le\nquestionnait, il pourrait dire avec vraisemblance qu’il essayait d’acheter des\nlames de rasoir.\nLe propriétaire venait d’allumer une\nsuspension à pétrole qui répandait une odeur trouble, mais amicale. C’était un\nhomme de soixante ans, peut-être, frêle et courbé, au nez long et bienveillant,\ndont les yeux au regard doux étaient déformés par des lunettes épaisses. Ses\ncheveux étaient presque blancs, mais ses sourcils broussailleux étaient encore\nnoirs. Ses lunettes, ses gestes affairés et courtois et le fait qu’il portait\nune jaquette de velours noir usé, lui prêtaient un vague air d’intellectualité,\ncomme s’il avait été quelque homme de lettres, ou peut-être un musicien. Sa\nvoix était douce, comme désuète, et son accent moins vulgaire que celui de la\nplupart des prolétaires.\n— Je vous ai reconnu sur le\ntrottoir, dit-il immédiatement. Vous êtes le monsieur qui avez acheté l’album\nde souvenirs de jeune femme. C’était un superbe morceau, certes. Vergé blanc,\non appelait ce papier. On n’en a pas fabriqué comme cela depuis… Oh ! je\npuis dire cinquante ans ! – Il regarda Winston par-dessus ses lunettes. –\nDésirez-vous quelque chose ? Ou voulez-vous seulement jeter un coup\nd’œil ?\n— Je suis entré en passant,\nrépondit vaguement Winston. Je ne désire rien de spécial.\n— Tant mieux, dit l’autre, car\nje ne pense pas que je pourrais vous satisfaire. – Il fit un geste d’excuse de\nsa main à la paume grassouillette. – Vous voyez comment c’est. On pourrait dire\nun magasin vide. De vous à moi, le commerce d’antiquités est mort. Plus aucune\ndemande, plus de marchandises. Meubles, porcelaine, verres, tout s’est cassé au\nfur et à mesure.

Il y a des années que je n’ai vu un bougeoir en cuivre, des\nannées !\nL’intérieur étroit du magasin était,\nen fait, bourré jusqu’à être inconfortable, mais il n’y avait presque rien qui\neût la moindre valeur. L’espace du parquet libre était très réduit car, tout\nautour, sur les murs, d’innombrables cadres poussiéreux étaient empilés.\nIl y avait en devanture des plateaux\nd’écrous et de boulons, des ciseaux usés, des canifs aux lames cassées, des\nmontres ternies qui n’avaient même pas la prétention de pouvoir marcher, et\nd’autres bricoles de tous genres. Seul, un fouillis d’objets dépareillés et de\nmorceaux qui se trouvait dans un coin, sur une petite table – tabatières\nlaquées, broches en agate et autres – pouvait contenir quelque chose\nd’intéressant.\nWinston se dirigeait vers la table\nquand son regard fut attiré par un objet rond et lisse qui brillait doucement à\nla lumière de la lampe. Il s’en saisit.\nC’était un lourd bloc de verre,\ncourbe d’un côté, aplati de l’autre, qui formait presque un hémisphère. Il y\navait une douceur particulière, rappelant celle de l’eau de pluie, à la fois\ndans la couleur et la texture du verre. Au milieu du bloc, magnifié par la\nsurface courbe, se trouvait un étrange objet, rose et convoluté, qui rappelait\nune rose ou une anémone de mer.\n— Qu’est-ce que c’est ?\ndemanda Winston fasciné.\n— C’est du corail, répondit le\nvieillard. Il doit provenir de l’océan Indien. On l’encastrait d’ordinaire dans\ndu verre. Il y a au moins cent ans que cet objet a été fabriqué. Plus même,\nd’après son aspect.\n— C’est une superbe chose, dit\nWinston.\n— C’est une belle chose,\napprouva l’autre. Mais il n’y a pas beaucoup de gens qui le diraient,\naujourd’hui. – Il toussa. – Eh bien, si vous désiriez par hasard l’acheter, il\nvous coûterait quatre dollars. Je me souviens d’un temps où un objet comme\ncelui-là aurait atteint huit livres, et huit livres, c’était… je ne peux le\ncalculer, mais c’était pas mal d’argent. Mais qui, aujourd’hui, s’intéresse aux\nantiquités authentiques, même au peu qui en existe encore ?\nWinston paya immédiatement les\nquatre dollars et glissa dans sa poche l’objet convoité. Ce qui lui plaisait\ndans cet objet, ce n’était pas tellement sa beauté, que son air d’appartenir à\nun âge tout à fait différent de l’âge actuel. Le verre doux et couleur d’eau de\npluie ne ressemblait à aucun verre qu’il eût jamais vu. L’apparente inutilité\nde l’objet le rendait doublement attrayant.

What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of \'The Times\' had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs — to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place. The largest section of the Records Department, far larger than the one on which Winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction.

The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century. The cyclical movement of history was now intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it was alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become technically possible. It was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable. Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of machine production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power, human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human imagination for ','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('6455f1e9-0e39-43c5-9854-b03de6b0f67d','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',120,'haven\'t seen a brass candlestick in years.\' The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The floorspace was very restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture-frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends — lacquered snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like — which looked as though they might include something interesting. As Winston wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight, and he picked it up. It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone. \'What is it?\' said Winston, fascinated. \'That\'s coral, that is,\' said the old man. \'It must have come from the Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the glass. That wasn\'t made less than a hundred years ago.

Her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made simian by thinness. Very occasionally she would take Winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything. He was aware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this was somehow connected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen. He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, closesmelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. There was a gas ring in the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He remembered his mother\'s statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. Above all he remembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly, over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share.

Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended. Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio\'d face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston\'s own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC.

The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. When once you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference. Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream of history. And yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. They were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed human. They had not become hardened inside. They had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort.

He quailed. There was pain coming, a new kind of pain. O\'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his. \"This time it will not hurt,\' he said. \'Keep your eyes fixed on mine.\' At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like an explosion, though it was not certain whether there was any noise. There was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light. Winston was not hurt, only prostrated. Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position. A terrific painless blow had flattened him out. Also something had happened inside his head. As his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized the face that was gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain. \'It will not last,\' said O\'Brien. \'Look me in the eyes. What country is Oceania at war with?\' Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania and that he himself was a citizen of Oceania. He also remembered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was at war with whom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware that there was any war. \'I don\'t remember.\' \'Oceania is at war with Eastasia.

The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm, was still in his face. He is not pretending, thought Winston, he is not a hypocrite, he believes every word he says.

From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doves. He was a bit early.

Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place. In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in London. There were no telescreens, of course, but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting attention. For distances of less than 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who examined the papers of any Party member they found there and asked awkward questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being followed.

The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch, but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began picking some partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the best thing to do. It might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. To look round was to show guilt. He picked another and another. A hand fell lightly on his shoulder. He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warning that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that way before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed, still clasping his bunch of flowers.

The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more subdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington\'s appearance. His eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight. \'Pick up those pieces,\' he said sharply. A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disappeared; Winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen. Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was not wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp glance, as though verifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He was still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. His body had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation. The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty It occurred to Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('68d7a4d2-a549-4404-863a-0e5d764c8503','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',156,'almost at the level of their faces.

It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only in low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small, beetle-like man was listening intently — listening to that. But by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stopped thinking and merely felt.

Il\ndevait y avoir neuf, dix, peut-être onze ans qu’ils s’étaient séparés. Qu’il\npensât si peu à elle, c’était tout de même curieux. Il était capable d’oublier\npendant des jours qu’il avait jamais été marié. Ils étaient restés ensemble\nenviron quinze mois seulement. Le Parti ne permettait pas le divorce, mais il\nencourageait plutôt les séparations lorsqu’il n’y avait pas d’enfants.\nCatherine était une fille grande,\nblonde, très droite, aux gestes magnifiques. Elle avait un visage hardi,\naquilin, un visage que l’on aurait pu qualifier de noble si l’on ne découvrait\nque, derrière ce visage, il n’y avait à peu près rien. Tout au début de leur\nvie conjugale, il avait décidé (mais peut-être était-ce seulement parce qu’il\nla connaissait plus intimement) qu’elle avait, sans contredit, l’esprit le plus\nstupide, le plus vulgaire, le plus vide qu’il eût jamais rencontré. Elle\nn’avait pas une idée dans la tête qui ne fût un slogan et il n’y avait aucune\nimbécillité, absolument aucune, qu’elle ne fût capable d’avaler si le Parti la\nlui suggérait. Il la surnomma mentalement : « L’enregistrement\nsonore. » Cependant, il aurait supporté de vivre avec elle s’il n’y avait\neu, précisément, le sexe. Dès qu’il la touchait, elle semblait reculer et se\nroidir. L’embrasser était comme embrasser une image de bois articulée. Ce qui\nétait étrange, c’est que même quand elle semblait le serrer contre elle, il\navait l’impression qu’elle le repoussait en même temps de toutes ses forces.\nC’était la rigidité de ses muscles qui produisait cette impression. Elle\nrestait étendue, les yeux fermés, sans résister ni coopérer, mais en se\nsoumettant. C’était extrêmement embarrassant et, après quelque temps, horrible.\nMême alors, il aurait supporté pourtant de vivre avec elle s’il avait été\nentendu qu’il y avait entre eux une séparation de corps. Mais, assez\ncurieusement, c’est Catherine qui avait refusé. Ils devaient, disait-elle,\ndonner naissance à un enfant, s’ils le pouvaient. La performance continua donc\nune fois par semaine, régulièrement. Elle avait même l’habitude, chaque fois\nque ce n’était pas impossible, de la lui rappeler le matin, comme une chose qui\ndevait être faite le soir et qu’on ne devait pas oublier. Elle avait deux\nphrases pour désigner cela. L’une était : « fabriquer un bébé »\net l’autre : « Notre devoir envers le Parti. » (Oui, elle avait\nréellement employé cette phrase.) Il se mit très vite à éprouver un véritable\nsentiment de frayeur chaque fois que le jour fixé revenait. Heureusement, aucun\nenfant n’apparut et, à la fin, elle accepta de renoncer à essayer. Bientôt\naprès, ils se séparaient.\nWinston soupira sans bruit.

Pourquoi devait-il toujours en être ainsi ? Pourquoi\nne pouvait-il avoir une femme à lui et non, à des années d’intervalle, ces\nimmondes mégères ? Mais une réelle aventure d’amour était un événement\npresque inimaginable. Les femmes du Parti étaient toutes semblables. La\nchasteté était aussi profondément enracinée chez elles que la fidélité au\nParti. Le sentiment naturel leur avait été arraché par des conditions de vie\nspéciales, appliquées très tôt, par des jeux et par l’eau froide, par les\nabsurdités qu’on leur cornait aux oreilles à l’école, chez les Espions, à la\nLigue de la Jeunesse, par des lectures, des parades, des chansons, des slogans,\nde la musique martiale. Sa raison lui disait qu’il devait y avoir des\nexceptions, mais son cœur n’en croyait rien. Elles étaient toutes imprenables,\ntelles que le Parti entendait qu’elles fussent et ce qu’il désirait plus encore\nque d’être aimé, c’était, une seule fois dans sa vie, abattre ce mur de vertu.\nL’acte sexuel accompli avec succès était un acte de rébellion. Le désir était\nun crime de la pensée. Éveiller les sens de Catherine, bien qu’elle fût sa\nfemme, eût été, s’il avait pu y parvenir, comme une violation.\nMais le reste de son histoire valait\nd’être écrit. Il continua :\nJe tournai le bouton de la lampe.\nQuand je la vis en pleine lumière…\nAprès l’obscurité, la faible lumière\nde la lampe à pétrole avait paru très brillante. Pour la première fois, il\navait pu voir la femme distinctement. Il s’était avancé d’un pas vers elle puis\ns’était arrêté, plein de convoitise et de terreur. Il était douloureusement\nconscient du risque qu’il courait en venant là. Il était parfaitement possible\nque les policiers le cueillent à la sortie. À bien y penser, ils étaient\npeut-être en ce moment en train de l’attendre de l’autre côté de la porte. S’il\ns’en allait sans même faire ce qu’il était venu faire ?…\nIl devait l’écrire, il devait le\nconfesser. Ce qu’il avait soudain vu à la lumière de la lampe, c’est que la\nfemme était vieille.

He might be ALONE in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also be wrong. He picked up the children\'s history book and looked at the portrait of Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you — something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable what then? But no!

One of the notices carried a printed list of the members of the Chess Committee, of whom Syme had been one. It looked almost exactly as it had looked before — nothing had been crossed out — but it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme had ceased to exist: he had never existed. The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministry the windowless, air-conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature, but outside the pavements scorched one\'s feet and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours was a horror. The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and the staffs of all the Ministries were working overtime.

Quand il l’atteignit, il identifia une main, sectionnée au\npoignet. La coupure était rouge, mais la main était si blême qu’elle\nressemblait à un moulage de plâtre.\nIl poussa la chose du pied dans le\ncaniveau puis, pour éviter la foule, tourna à droite dans une rue transversale.\nEn trois ou quatre minutes, il était hors de la zone sinistrée et les rues\nsordides avaient repris leur animation grouillante, comme s’il ne s’était rien\npassé.\nIl était près de huit heures et les\ncafés que fréquentaient les prolétaires (on les appelait des\n« bistrots ») étaient combles. Par leurs crasseuses portes\ntournantes, qui s’ouvraient et se refermaient sans cesse, venait une odeur\nd’urine, de sciure de bois et de bière aigre. Dans un angle formé par une façade\nen saillie, trois hommes étaient groupés. Celui du milieu tenait un journal\nplié que les deux autres étudiaient par-dessus son épaule. Avant même qu’il fût\nassez près pour déchiffrer l’expression de leurs visages, Winston put constater\nleur état de tension par toutes les lignes de leurs corps. C’étaient évidemment\ndes nouvelles sérieuses qu’ils lisaient. Il les avait dépassés de quelques pas\nquand, soudain, le groupe se disloqua et deux hommes entrèrent dans une\nviolente altercation. Ils semblèrent, un moment, presque sur le point d’en\nvenir aux mains.\n— Est-ce que vous ne pouvez\npas, bon sang, écouter ce que je vous dis ? Je vous dis qu’aucun nombre\nterminé par sept n’a gagné depuis au moins quatorze mois.\n— Oui, il a gagné !\n— Non, il n’a pas gagné !\nÀ la maison, j’ai tous les numéros gagnants depuis au moins deux ans, inscrits\nsur un papier. Je les note aussi régulièrement qu’une horloge. Et je vous le\ndis, aucun nombre terminé par sept…\n— Oui, un sept a gagné. Je\npourrais presque vous dire ce sacré nombre. Il finissait par quatre, zéro,\nsept. C’était en février, la deuxième semaine de février.\n— Des prunes, votre février.\nJ’ai tout noté, noir sur blanc. Et je vous dis, aucun nombre…\n— Oh ! la ferme ! dit\nle troisième homme.\nIls parlaient de la loterie. Winston,\ntrente mètres plus loin, se retourna. Ils discutaient encore avec des visages\npleins d’ardeur et de passion. La loterie et les énormes prix qu’elle payait\nchaque semaine, était le seul événement public auquel les prolétaires portaient\nune sérieuse attention. Il y avait probablement quelques millions de\nprolétaires pour lesquels c’était la principale, sinon la seule raison de\nvivre. C’était leur plaisir, leur folie, leur calmant, leur stimulant\nintellectuel. Quand il s’agissait de loterie, même les gens qui savaient à\npeine lire et écrire, semblaient capables de calculs compliqués et de prodiges\nde mémoire déconcertants. Il y avait toute une classe de gens qui gagnaient\nleur vie simplement en vendant des systèmes, des prévisions, des amulettes\nporte-bonheur. Winston n’avait rien à voir avec le mécanisme de la loterie qui\nétait dirigé par le ministère de l’Abondance. Mais il savait, en vérité tout le\nmonde dans le Parti le savait, que les prix étaient pour la plupart fictifs. Il\nn’y avait que les petites sommes qui fussent réellement payées. Les gagnants\ndes gros prix étaient des gens qui n’existaient pas. Ce n’était pas difficile à\narranger, vu l’absence de toute réelle communication entre une partie et\nl’autre de l’Océania.\nMais s’il y avait un espoir, il se\ntrouvait chez les prolétaires. Il fallait s’accrocher à cela. La formule,\nexprimée en mots, paraissait raisonnable. C’est quand on regardait les êtres\nhumains qui vous croisaient sur le pavé qu’elle devenait un acte de foi. La rue\ndans laquelle Winston avait tourné descendait une colline. Il avait\nl’impression de s’être déjà trouvé dans ces parages et qu’il y avait, pas très\nloin, une artère importante. Un vacarme de voix criardes venait de quelque part\nen avant. La rue fit un coude brusque puis se termina par un escalier qui\nmenait à une allée encaissée où quelques marchands vendaient en plein air des\nlégumes fanés.\nWinston, alors, reconnut l’endroit.\nL’allée s’ouvrait sur la rue principale et au premier tournant, à moins de cinq\nminutes, se trouvait le magasin d’antiquités où il avait acheté le livre neuf\nqui était maintenant son journal. Pas très loin, dans une petite papeterie, il\navait acheté son porte-plume et sa bouteille d’encre.\nIl s’arrêta un instant en haut de\nl’escalier. De l’autre côté de l’allée, il y avait un petit bistrot sale dont\nles fenêtres paraissaient couvertes de givre, mais qui étaient simplement, en\nréalité, enduites de poussière. Un très vieil homme, courbé, mais actif, dont\nles moustaches blanches se hérissaient comme celles d’une crevette, poussa la\nporte tournante et entra. Tandis que Winston le regardait, il lui vint à l’idée\nque le vieillard, qui devait avoir au moins quatre-vingts ans, était déjà un\nhomme mûr au moment de la Révolution. Lui, et quelques autres comme lui, étaient\nles derniers liens existant actuellement avec le monde capitaliste disparu.\nDans le Parti lui-même, il ne restait pas beaucoup de gens dont les idées\navaient été formées avant la Révolution. La vieille génération avait en grande\npartie été balayée au cours des grandes épurations qui avaient eu lieu entre\nmil neuf cent cinquante et mil neuf cent soixante-dix. Le petit nombre de ceux\nqui avaient survécu avait depuis longtemps été amené, terrifié, à une complète\nabdication intellectuelle. S’il y avait quelqu’un au monde capable de faire un\nexposé exact des conditions de vie dans la première partie du siècle, ce ne\npouvait être qu’un prolétaire.\nWinston se remémora soudain le\npassage du livre d’Histoire qu’il avait copié dans son journal et une folle\nimpulsion s’empara de lui. Il irait dans le bistrot, il réussirait à entrer en\nrelation avec le vieillard, puis il le questionnerait. Il lui dirait :\n« Parlez-moi de votre vie quand vous étiez un petit garçon. À quoi\nressemblait-elle à cette époque ? Les choses étaient-elles meilleures, ou\npires ','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('6c721b75-f893-415a-9774-b991fa793622','2024-04-05 05:06:48','2024-04-05 05:06:48','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',7,'l’Eurasia,\ndéfendait la liberté de parler, la liberté de la presse, la liberté de réunion,\nla liberté de pensée. Il criait hystériquement que la révolution avait été\ntrahie, et cela en un rapide discours polysyllabique qui était une parodie du\nstyle habituel des orateurs du Parti et comprenait même des mots novlangue,\nplus de mots novlangue même qu’aucun orateur du Parti n’aurait normalement\nemployés dans la vie réelle. Et pendant ce temps, pour que personne ne pût\ndouter de la réalité de ce que recouvrait le boniment spécieux de Goldstein,\nderrière sa tête, sur l’écran, marchaient les colonnes sans fin de l’armée\neurasienne, rang après rang d’hommes à l’aspect robuste, aux visages\ninexpressifs d’Asiatiques, qui venaient déboucher sur l’écran et\ns’évanouissaient, pour être immédiatement remplacés par d’autres exactement\nsemblables. Le sourd martèlement rythmé des bottes des soldats formait\nl’arrière-plan de la voix bêlante de Goldstein.\nAvant les trente secondes de la\nHaine, la moitié des assistants laissait échapper des exclamations de rage. Le\nvisage de mouton satisfait et la terrifiante puissance de l’armée eurasienne\nétaient plus qu’on n’en pouvait supporter. Par ailleurs, voir Goldstein, ou\nmême penser à lui, produisait automatiquement la crainte et la colère. Il était\nun objet de haine plus constant que l’Eurasia ou l’Estasia, puisque lorsque\nl’Océania était en guerre avec une de ces puissances, elle était généralement\nen paix avec l’autre. Mais l’étrange était que, bien que Goldstein fût haï et\nméprisé par tout le monde, bien que tous les jours et un millier de fois par\njour, sur les estrades, aux télécrans, dans les journaux, dans les livres, ses\nthéories fussent réfutées, écrasées, ridiculisées, que leur pitoyable sottise\nfût exposée aux regards de tous, en dépit de tout cela, son influence ne\nsemblait jamais diminuée. Il y avait toujours de nouvelles dupes qui\nattendaient d’être séduites par lui. Pas un jour ne se passait que des espions\net des saboteurs à ses ordres ne fussent démasqués par la Police de la Pensée.\nIl commandait une grande armée ténébreuse, un réseau clandestin de\nconspirateurs qui se consacraient à la chute de l’État. On croyait que cette\narmée s’appelait la Fraternité. Il y avait aussi des histoires que l’on\nchuchotait à propos d’un livre terrible, résumé de toutes les hérésies, dont\nGoldstein était l’auteur, et qui circulait clandestinement çà et là. Ce livre\nn’avait pas de titre. Les gens s’y référaient, s’ils s’y référaient jamais, en\ndisant simplement le livre. Mais on ne savait de telles choses que par\nde vagues rumeurs. Ni la Fraternité, ni le livre, n’étaient des sujets\nqu’un membre ordinaire du Parti mentionnerait s’il pouvait l’éviter.\nÀ la seconde minute, la Haine tourna\nau délire. Les gens sautaient sur place et criaient de toutes leurs forces pour\ns’efforcer de couvrir le bêlement affolant qui venait de l’écran. Même le lourd\nvisage d’O’Brien était rouge. Il était assis très droit sur sa chaise. Sa\npuissante poitrine se gonflait et se contractait comme pour résister à l’assaut\nd’une vague. La petite femme aux cheveux roux avait tourné au rose vif, et sa\nbouche s’ouvrait et se fermait comme celle d’un poisson hors de l’eau. La fille\nbrune qui était derrière Winston criait : « Cochon !\nCochon ! Cochon ! » Elle saisit soudain un lourd dictionnaire\nnovlangue et le lança sur l’écran. Il atteignit le nez de Goldstein et\nrebondit. La voix continuait, inexorable. Dans un moment de lucidité, Winston\nse vit criant avec les autres et frappant violemment du talon contre les\nbarreaux de sa chaise. L’horrible, dans ces Deux Minutes de la Haine, était,\nnon qu’on fût obligé d’y jouer un rôle, mais que l’on ne pouvait, au contraire,\néviter de s’y joindre. Au bout de trente secondes, toute feinte, toute dérobade\ndevenait inutile. Une hideuse extase, faite de frayeur et de rancune, un désir\nde tuer, de torturer, d’écraser des visages sous un marteau, semblait se\nrépandre dans l’assistance comme un courant électrique et transformer chacun,\nmême contre sa volonté, en un fou vociférant et grimaçant.\nMais la rage que ressentait chacun\nétait une émotion abstraite, indirecte, que l’on pouvait tourner d’un objet\nvers un autre comme la flamme d’un photophore. Ainsi, à un moment, la haine\nqu’éprouvait Winston n’était pas du tout dirigée contre Goldstein, mais contre\nBig Brother, le Parti et la Police de la Pensée. À de tels instants, son cœur\nallait au solitaire hérétique bafoué sur l’écran, seul gardien de la vérité et\ndu bon sens dans un monde de mensonge. Pourtant, l’instant d’après, Winston\nétait de cœur avec les gens qui l’entouraient et tout ce que l’on disait de\nGoldstein lui semblait vrai. Sa secrète aversion contre Big Brother se\nchangeait alors en adoration. Big Brother semblait s’élever, protecteur\ninvincible et sans frayeur dressé comme un roc contre les hordes asiatiques.\nGoldstein, en dépit de son isolement, de son impuissance et du doute qui\nplanait sur son existence même, semblait un sinistre enchanteur capable, par le\nseul pouvoir de sa voix, de briser la structure de la civilisation.\nOn pouvait même, par moments,\ntourner le courant de sa haine dans une direction ou une autre par un acte\nvolontaire. Par un violent effort analogue à celui par lequel, dans un\ncauchemar, la tête s’arrache de l’oreiller, Winston réussit soudain à\ntransférer sa haine, du visage qui était sur l’écran, à la fille aux cheveux\nnoirs placée derrière lui. De vivaces et splendides hallucinations lui\ntraversèrent rapidement l’esprit. Cette fille, il la fouettait à mort avec une\ntrique de caoutchouc. Il l’attachait nue à un poteau et la criblait de flèches\ncomme un saint Sébastien. Il la violait et, au moment de la jouissance, lui\ncoupait la gorge. Il réalisa alors, mieux qu’auparavant, pour quelle raison,\nexactement, il la détestait. Il la détestait parce qu’elle était jeune, jolie\net asexuée, parce qu’il désirait coucher avec elle et qu’il ne le ferait\njamais, parce qu’autour de sa ','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('6d1bbb8b-9a50-4186-9b8e-4c2b13c94107','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',242,'ing the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter — set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call \'the proles\'. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival. War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('6d8de5bb-7743-42b8-868b-091198f9e192','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',124,'ed: \'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement\'s!\' \'What\'s that?\' said Winston. \'Oh — \'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement\'s.\' That was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy.

All the London churches were in it — all the principal ones, that is.\' Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was always difficult to determine the age of a London building. Anything large and impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle Ages. The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value. One could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the names of streets — anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered. \'I never knew it had been a church,\' he said. \'There\'s a lot of them left, really\' said the old man, \'though they\'ve been put to other uses.

It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary. Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being non-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange. But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers were selling tiredlooking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered where he was.

He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his father\'s shoes) and wearing spectacles. The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties. At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes. Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean place — the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave — but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards. They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. There was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever.

On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the booming of guns — after six days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them to pieces — at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally. There was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place. Merely it became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when it happened. It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit. The square was packed with several thousand people, including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies. On a scarlet- draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd.

And this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were the huge printing-shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts, and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs. There was the teleprogrammes section with its engineers, its producers, and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall. There were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who co-ordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence. And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch of the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('71e85def-b453-4054-b941-698c0e4e3785','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',339,'\'It would have no vitality.

Moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement O\'Brien would twist the dial again. And yet he could not keep silent.

They worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands — the capitalists, they were called — who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was to own.

To the death of Big Brother? To humanity? To the future?\' \'To the past,\' said Winston. \'The past is more important,\' agreed O\'Brien gravely. They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood up to go. O\'Brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. It was important, he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very observant. As soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence. He took another pace or two up and down, then stopped. \'There are details to be settled,\' he said. \'I assume that you have a hiding-place of some kind?\'  223','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('73cb4c0d-b522-4b91-8bd9-1d0c3207c659','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',180,'to be full of bugs, but who cares?\' said Julia. One never saw a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles. Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia had never been in one before, so far as she could remember. Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not stir, because Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove. \'Half that water\'s boiled away\' she said. \'I\'ll get up and make some coffee in another moment. We\'ve got an hour. What time do they cut the lights off at your flats?\' \'Twenty-three thirty\' \'It\'s twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in earlier than that, because— Hi!

Then everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment came crowding back again.

It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticed his surroundings. All he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only a metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. He was strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not even his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind, forcing him to look straight in front of him.

C’était un lourd murmure sonore,\ncurieusement sauvage, derrière lequel semblaient retentir un bruit de pieds nus\net un battement de tam-tams. Le chant dura peut-être trente secondes.

Pendant les Deux Minutes de la Haine, il ne pouvait s’empêcher de\npartager le délire général, mais ce chant sous-humain de « B-B !…\nB-B !…» l’emplissait toujours d’horreur. Naturellement il chantait avec\nles autres. Il était impossible de faire autrement. Déguiser ses sentiments,\nmaîtriser son expression, faire ce que faisaient les autres étaient des\nréactions instinctives.

Un message clair avait passé. C’était comme si leurs deux esprits\ns’étaient ouverts et que leurs pensées avaient coulé de l’un à l’autre par\nleurs yeux. « Je suis avec vous » semblait lui dire O’Brien.\n« Je sais exactement ce que vous ressentez.

De tels incidents n’avaient jamais aucune suite.\nLeur seul effet était de garder vivace en lui la croyance, l’espoir, que\nd’autres que lui étaient les ennemis du Parti. Peut-être les rumeurs de vastes\nconspirations étaient-elles après tout exactes ! Peut-être la Fraternité\nexistait-elle réellement !

On ne possédait pas de preuves, mais seulement de vacillantes\nlueurs qui pouvaient tout signifier, ou rien : bribes entendues de\nconversations, griffonnages indistincts sur les murs des waters – une fois\nmême, lors de la rencontre de deux étrangers, un léger mouvement des mains qui\naurait pu être un signe de reconnaissance. Ce n’étaient que des suppositions.\nIl avait probablement tout imaginé. Il était retourné à son bureau sans avoir\nde nouveau regardé O’Brien.

It paid, she said, it was camouflage. If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. She even induced Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party members.

When they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up. It was a blazing afternoon. The air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung.

As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her. He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. He could not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself. He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet. It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. The lights would be switched off at the main at twentythree thirty. He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacup ful of Victory Gin. Then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. But he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness. It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some people did so. Many of the disappearances were actually suicides.

Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too — in some more complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONE in the possession of a memory? The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters, more books, more babies — more of everything except disease, crime, and insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen. A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes.

What is concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest.

He had not stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running, he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up again at the portrait of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode the world! The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain! He thought how ten minutes ago — yes, only ten minutes — there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army that had perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministry of Love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened, until this moment. The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little. The waiters were turning back to their work. One of them approached with the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any longer. He was back in the Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his soul white as snow. He was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating everybody. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. The long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain.

He was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms — one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended. At thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age.

A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language. Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom did swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention the Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He did not dislike it. It was merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways, and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay.

Motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth centuury have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon. To understand the nature of the present war — for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war — one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, Oceania by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and indus triousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of the super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth.

Il ne pouvait suivre les chiffres, mais il n’ignorait pas qu’ils étaient\nune cause de satisfaction. Il avait sorti une pipe énorme et sale, déjà bourrée\nà moitié de tabac noirci. Avec la ration de cent grammes par semaine de tabac,\nil était rarement possible de remplir une pipe jusqu’au bord.

At the start there had been a few boos and hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners, whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. One literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did one know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as war- criminals: the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labour camps. The round Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more European type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into Winston\'s, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed away again. The convoy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see an aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them bound together. It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part.

They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other. The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable... Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety.

The Party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies.

Beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg table, the glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness. In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups, provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine tablets. The clock\'s hands said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteentwenty really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly. Of all the crimes that a Party member could commit, this one was the least possible to conceal. Actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made no difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him. Nor did he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose of a love-affair.

In this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out. It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O\'Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no windows. His cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himself mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground. There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel door opened with a clang. A young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featured face was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The door clanged shut again.

The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers\' boots formed the background to Goldstein\'s bleating voice. Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room. The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were — in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less.

In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of Winston\'s arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.

In the Middle Ages there was the Inquisition. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they were unrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy. And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again. The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true.

With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. The frontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa.

To these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to them. They are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones. The slightly more favoured workers whom we call \'the proles\' are only intermittently conscious of the war. When it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening. It is in the ranks of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm is found. World- conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible. This peculiar linking-together of opposites — knowledge with ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism — is one of the chief distinguishing marks of Oceanic society. The official ideology abounds with contradictions even when there is no practical reason for them. Thus, the Party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it chooses to do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past, and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason. It systematically undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty.

Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty- five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move.

Winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening. Behind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. He was trying to count them, he could not remember why. He knew only that it was impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four.

But of course you can never tell; people are such hypocrites.\' She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, everything came back to her own sexuality. As soon as this was touched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of the Party\'s sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party\'s control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way she put it was: \'When you make love you\'re using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and don\'t give a damn for anything. They can\'t bear you to feel like that.

And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain. Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking, darkchinned man named Tillotson was working steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. He looked up, and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston\'s direction. Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed on. People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs. In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name, though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the Press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. There was a certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier.

They were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappeared round the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant, then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in his dream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her body gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did not look at her body; his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile.

All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them very little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of the Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce was permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it. They were beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: \'Proles and animals are free.\' Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. It had begun itching again. The thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been like.

It\'s that sub you forgot to give me.\' \'Which sub is that?\' said Winston, automatically feeling for money. About a quarter of one\'s salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions, which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them. \'For Hate Week. You know — the house-by-house fund. I\'m treasurer for our block. We\'re making an all-out effort — going to put on a tremendous show. I tell you, it won\'t be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn\'t have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street.

I gave him a good dressing-down for it. In fact I told him I\'d take the catapult away if he does it again.\' \'I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,\' said Winston. \'Ah, well — what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn\'t it?

A twinge of pain shot through Winston\'s jaw. O\'Brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the cell. \'You are rotting away\' he said; \'you are falling to pieces. What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn around and look into that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human, that is humanity.

Only one thought stirred in his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined. Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him. Before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears. He was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but he could not stop himself.

At the door Winston looked back, but O\'Brien seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. He was waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. Beyond him Winston could see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers. The incident was closed. Within thirty seconds, it occurred to him, O\'Brien would be back at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party. 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('8e783604-a5c5-4835-b083-7decf306a61f','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',105,'ulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then north again, losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going. \'If there is hope,\' he had written in the diary, \'it lies in the proles.\' The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity. He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slums to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes. There were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow alley- ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in astonishing numbers — girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years\' time, and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers. Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up. Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity.

In the room over Mr Charrington\'s shop, when they could get there, Julia and Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window, naked for the sake of coolness. The rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or clean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes, and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter-attack. Four, five, six — seven times they met during the month of June. Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed to have lost the need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. Now that they had a secure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time. What mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. To know that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The room was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk. Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He usually stopped to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs.

No imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if Katharine, Winston\'s wife, could somehow have been got rid of. It was hopeless even as a daydream. \'What was she like, your wife?\' said Julia. \'She was — do you know the Newspeak word GOODTHINKFUL?

Actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable, and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all. Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary, so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three sheaves of corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives are dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the fact that there IS no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character. In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In the past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality.

Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful. He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover. For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do. But it had also been suggested by the book that he had 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('926058d0-2d48-451a-bb24-c5ae837b0516','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',46,'and how much invented. Winston could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into existence. He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before 1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form — \'English Socialism\', that is to say — it had been current earlier. Everything melted into mist. Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact. And on that occasion  \'Smith!\' screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. \'6079 Smith W.! Yes, YOU! Bend lower, please! You can do better than that. You\'re not trying. Lower, please! THAT\'S better, comrade. Now stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch me.\' A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston\'s body. His face remained completely inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show resentment! A single flicker of the eyes could give you away. He stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head and — one could not say gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency — bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes. \'THERE, comrades! THAT\'S how I want to see you doing it. Watch me again. I\'m thirty-nine and I\'ve had four children.

I can\'t come.\' \'Why not?\' \'Oh, the usual reason. It\'s started early this time.\' For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it. Their first love-making had been simply an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. The smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feeling that she was cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. It struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that they were a married couple of ten years\' standing. He wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household. He wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the following day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington\'s room had oc 175','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('93dfa488-453e-43e2-a799-1ee4b8268b70','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',230,'the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been changed. The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said, \'Excuse me, I think you\'ve dropped your briefcase.\' He took the brief-case abstractedly, without speaking. He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the time was now nearly twenty-three hours. The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise. The orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to their posts, were hardly necessary. Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete. Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs — all had to be rectified at lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was known that the chiefs of the Department intended that within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia, 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('94265d54-3594-4349-8b36-772db48c5dc0','2024-04-05 05:06:49','2024-04-05 05:06:49','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',20,'était plus probable, c’était arrivé\nsimplement parce que les épurations et les vaporisations font nécessairement\npartie du mécanisme de l’État.\nLe seul indice réel reposait sur les\nmots : ref nonêtres, qui indiquaient que Withers était actuellement\nmort. On ne pouvait toujours présumer que tel était le cas chaque fois que des\ngens étaient arrêtés. Quelquefois, ils étaient relâchés et on leur permettait\nde rester en liberté pendant un an ou même deux avant de les exécuter. Parfois,\ntrès rarement, un individu qu’on avait cru mort depuis longtemps réapparaissait\ncomme un fantôme dans quelque procès public, impliquait par son témoignage une\ncentaine d’autres personnes puis disparaissait, cette fois pour toujours.\nWithers, cependant, était déjà un nonêtre.\nIl n’existait pas, il n’avait jamais existé. Winston décida qu’il ne serait pas\nsuffisant de se borner à inverser le sens de l’allocution de Big Brother. Il\nvalait mieux la faire rouler sur un sujet sans aucun rapport avec le sujet\nprimitif.\nIl aurait pu faire de ce discours\nl’habituelle dénonciation des traîtres et des criminels par la pensée, mais ce\nserait trop flagrant. Inventer une victoire sur le front ou quelque triomphe de\nla surproduction dans le Neuvième Plan triennal compliquerait trop le travail\ndes Archives. Ce qu’il fallait, c’était un morceau de pure fantaisie. L’image,\ntoute prête, d’un certain camarade Ogilvy, qui serait récemment mort à la\nguerre en d’héroïques circonstances, lui vint soudain à l’esprit.\nEn effet, Big Brother, en certaines\ncirconstances, consacrait son ordre du jour à la glorification de quelque\nhumble et simple soldat, membre du Parti, dont la vie aussi bien que la mort\noffrait un exemple digne d’être suivi. Cette fois, Big Brother glorifierait le\ncamarade Ogilvy. À la vérité, il n’y avait pas de camarade Ogilvy, mais\nquelques lignes imprimées et deux photographies maquillées l’amèneraient à\nexister.\nWinston réfléchit un moment, puis\nrapprocha de lui le phonoscript et se mit à dicter dans le style familier à Big\nBrother. Un style à la fois militaire et pédant, facile à imiter à cause de\nl’habitude de Big Brother de poser des questions et d’y répondre tout de suite.\n(« Quelle leçon pouvons-nous tirer de ce fait, camarades ? La leçon…\nqui est aussi un des principes fondamentaux de l’Angsoc… que…» et ainsi de\nsuite.)\nÀ trois ans, le camarade Ogilvy\nrefusait tous les jouets. Il n’acceptait qu’un tambour, une mitraillette et un\nhélicoptère en miniature. À six ans, une année à l’avance, par une dispense\ntoute spéciale, il rejoignait les Espions. À neuf, il était chef de groupe. À\nonze, il dénonçait son oncle à la Police de la Pensée. Il avait entendu une\nconversation dont les tendances lui avaient paru criminelles. À dix-sept ans,\nil était moniteur d’une section de la Ligue Anti-Sexe des Juniors. À dix-neuf\nans, il inventait une grenade à main qui était adoptée par le ministère de la\nPaix. Au premier essai, cette grenade tuait d’un coup trente prisonniers\neurasiens. À vingt-trois ans, il était tué en service commandé. Poursuivi par\ndes chasseurs ennemis, alors qu’il survolait l’océan Indien avec d’importantes\ndépêches, il s’était lesté de sa mitrailleuse, et il avait sauté, avec les\ndépêches et tout, de l’hélicoptère dans l’eau profonde.\nC’était une fin, disait Big Brother,\nqu’il était impossible de contempler sans un sentiment d’envie. Big Brother\najoutait quelques remarques sur la pureté et la rectitude de la vie du camarade\nOgilvy. Il avait renoncé à tout alcool, même au vin et à la bière. Il ne fumait\npas. Il ne prenait aucune heure de récréation, sauf celle qu’il passait chaque\njour au gymnase. Il avait fait vœu de célibat. Le mariage et le soin d’une\nfamille étaient, pensait-il, incompatibles avec un dévouement de vingt-quatre\nheures par jour au devoir. Il n’avait comme sujet de conversation que les\nprincipes de l’Angsoc. Rien dans la vie ne l’intéressait que la défaite de\nl’armée eurasienne et la chasse aux espions, aux saboteurs, aux criminels par\nla pensée, aux traîtres en général.\nWinston débattit s’il accorderait au\ncamarade Ogilvy l’ordre du Mérite Insigne. Il décida que non, à cause du\nsupplémentaire renvoi aux références que cette récompense aurait entraîné.\nIl regarda une fois encore son rival\nde la cabine d’en face. Quelque chose lui disait que certainement Tillotson\nétait occupé à la même besogne que lui. Il n’y avait aucun moyen de savoir\nqu’elle rédaction serait finalement adoptée, mais il avait la conviction\nprofonde que ce serait la sienne. Le camarade Ogilvy, inexistant une heure plus\ntôt, était maintenant une réalité. Une étrange idée frappa Winston. On pouvait\ncréer des morts, mais il était impossible de créer des vivants. Le camarade\nOgilvy, qui n’avait jamais existé dans le présent, existait maintenant dans le\npassé, et quand la falsification serait oubliée, son existence aurait autant\nd’authenticité, autant d’évidence que celle de Charlemagne ou de Jules César.\n \n\n\nTable of ','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('9433119c-6f8e-450b-934b-4e0d514a74d7','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',360,'of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances. Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. They were enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat\'s muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey. \'The rat,\' said O\'Brien, still addressing his invisible audience, \'although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of that. You will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. In some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes. The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dying people. They show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless.\' There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach Winston from far away. The rats were fighting; they were trying to get at each other through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of despair. That, too, seemed to come from outside himself. O\'Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it. There was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head, was held immovably. O\'Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a metre from Winston\'s face.

And then — no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just ONE person to whom he could transfer his punishment — ONE body that he could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically, over and over. \'Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don\'t care what you do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!\' He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. He was still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars — always away, away, away from the rats. He was light years distant, but O\'Brien was still standing at his side. There was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek.

And the girl with dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department — she would never be vaporized either. It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for survival, it was not easy to say. At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. It was the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away again. The sweat started out on Winston\'s backbone. A horrible pang of terror went through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following him about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards. But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough. His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member of the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all.

It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every detail of her hand. He explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with its row of callouses, the smooth flesh under the wrist. Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girl\'s eyes were. They were probably brown, but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston out of nests of hair.

It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself— anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: FACECRIME, it was called. The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after all she was not really following him about, perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work, if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket.

It struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about. \'You can turn round now,\' said Julia.

Winston comprit qu’il en aurait accepté\ntrois, ou même deux.\n— Il y a une autre pièce\nlà-haut qui pourrait vous intéresser, dit-il. Elle ne contient pas grand-chose,\nquelques objets seulement. Nous prendrons une lampe pour monter.\nIl alluma une lampe et précéda\nWinston dans un escalier aux marches raides et usées puis le long d’un passage\nétroit. La pièce dans laquelle ils entrèrent ne donnait pas sur la rue. Elle\navait vue sur une cour pavée de galets et une forêt de cheminées. Winston\nremarqua que les meubles étaient encore disposés comme si la pièce devait être\nhabitée. Il y avait une carpette sur le parquet, un tableau ou deux aux murs,\net, tiré près de la cheminée, un fauteuil profond et usé. Une horloge ancienne\nen verre, qui n’avait que douze chiffres sur son cadran, faisait entendre son\ntic-tac sur la cheminée. Sous la fenêtre, un grand lit sur lequel se trouvait\nencore un matelas, occupait près du quart de la pièce.\n— Nous avons vécu ici jusqu’à\nla mort de ma femme, dit le vieillard en s’excusant à demi. Je vends le\nmobilier petit à petit. Voilà un beau lit de mahogany, ou du moins, ce serait\nun beau lit si on pouvait en enlever les punaises. Mais j’ose dire que vous le\ntrouveriez un peu encombrant.\nIl soulevait la lampe pour éclairer\ntoute la pièce et, dans la chaude lumière douteuse, l’endroit paraissait\ncurieusement hospitalier. L’idée traversa l’esprit de Winston qu’il serait\nprobablement très facile de louer la pièce pour quelques dollars par semaine,\ns’il osait s’y risquer. C’était une idée folle et impossible qui devait être\nabandonnée aussitôt que pensée, mais la pièce avait éveillé en lui une sorte de\nnostalgie, une sorte de mémoire ancestrale. Il lui semblait savoir exactement\nce que l’on ressentait en s’asseyant dans une pièce comme celle-ci, dans ce\nfauteuil auprès du feu, avec les pieds sur le garde-feu et une bouilloire à\ncôté du foyer. Être absolument seul, dans une paix complète, sans personne qui\nvous surveille, sans voix qui vous poursuive, n’entendre que le chant de la\nbouilloire et le tic-tac amical de l’horloge.\n— Il n’y a pas de télécran, ne\nput-il s’empêcher de murmurer.\n— Oh ! fit le vieil homme,\nje n’en ai jamais eu. C’est trop cher. Et je n’en ai d’ailleurs jamais senti le\nbesoin. Voilà une jolie table pliante, dans ce coin. Mais naturellement, si\nvous vouliez vous servir des battants, il vous faudrait mettre de nouveaux\ngonds.\nIl y avait une toute petite\nbibliothèque dans l’autre coin et, déjà Winston se dirigeait de ce côté. Elle\nne contenait que des livres sans intérêt. La chasse aux livres et leur\ndestruction avaient été faites avec autant de soin dans les quartiers\nprolétaires que partout ailleurs. Il était tout à fait improbable qu’il\nexistât, quelque part dans l’Océania, un exemplaire de livre imprimé avant\n1960.\nLe vieil homme, qui portait toujours\nla lampe, était debout devant un tableau encadré de bois de rose qui était\nsuspendu en face du lit, de l’autre côté de la cheminée.\n— Si par hasard vous vous\nintéressiez aux vieux tableaux, commença-t-il délicatement.\nWinston traversa la pièce pour\nexaminer le tableau. C’était une gravure sur acier représentant un édifice de\nforme ovale aux fenêtres rectangulaires, avec une petite tour en avant. Une\ngrille entourait l’édifice et, en arrière, on voyait quelque chose qui semblait\nêtre une statue. Winston regarda un moment la gravure. Le tableau lui semblait\nvaguement familier, bien qu’il ne se souvînt pas de la statue.\n— Le cadre est fixé au mur, dit\nle vieillard, mais je pourrais vous le dévisser, si vous le désiriez.\n— Je connais cet édifice, dit\nfinalement Winston. C’est maintenant une ruine. Il est au milieu de la rue qui\nse trouve de l’autre côté du Palais de justice.\n— C’est exact. Il a été\nbombardé en… oh ! il y a pas mal d’années. À un moment, c’était une\néglise. On l’appelait l’église Saint-Clément. – Il eut un sourire d’excuse,\ncomme conscient de dire quelque chose de légèrement ridicule, et ajouta :\n– Oranges et citrons, disent les cloches de Saint-Clément.\n— Qu’est-ce que cela ?\ndemanda Winston.\n— Oh ! « Oranges et\ncitrons, disent les cloches de Saint-Clément. » C’est une chanson que l’on\nchantait quand j’étais un petit garçon. Je ne me souviens pas de la suite, mais\nje sais qu’elle se terminait ainsi : Voici une bougie pour aller au lit,\nvoici un couperet pour vous couper la tête. Les enfants levaient les bras pour\nque vous passiez en dessous et quand on arrivait à : Voici un couperet\npour vous couper la tête, ils baissaient les bras et vous attrapaient. Toutes\nles églises de Londres y passaient. Les principales, du moins.\nWinston se demanda vaguement de quel\nsiècle était l’église. Il était toujours difficile de déterminer l’âge d’un\nédifice de Londres. Tous ceux qui étaient vastes et imposants étaient\nautomatiquement classés parmi les constructions d’après la Révolution s’ils\nétaient d’aspect raisonnablement nouveau. Mais tous ceux qui, visiblement,\nétaient plus anciens, étaient imputés à une période mal définie appelée Moyen\nÂge. On considérait que les siècles du capitalisme n’avaient rien produit qui\neût quelque valeur. On ne pouvait pas plus étudier l’histoire par\nl’architecture que par les livres. Les statues, les inscriptions, les pierres\ncommémoratives, les noms de rues, tout ce qui aurait pu jeter une lumière sur\nle passé, avait été systématiquement changé.\n— Je ne savais pas qu’elle\navait été une église, dit Winston.\n— Il y en a en réalité encore\npas mal, dit le vieillard, mais on leur a donné une autre affectation. Quelle\nétait donc la suite de cette chanson ? Ah ! Je sais. « Oranges\net citrons, disent les cloches de Saint-Clément.

It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy\'s eye, a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so. It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought. Mrs Parsons\' eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and back again. In the better light of the livingroom he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face. \"They do get so noisy\' she said. \'They\'re disappointed because they couldn\'t go to see the hanging, that\'s what it is. I\'m too busy to take them, and Tom won\'t be back from work in time.\' \'Why can\'t we go and see the hanging?\' roared the boy in his huge voice. \'Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!\' chanted the little girl, still capering round. Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the Park that evening, Winston remembered. This happened about once a month, and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see it. He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow. It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him.

But she was not interested in the finished product. She \'didn\'t much care for reading,\' she said. Books were just a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces. She had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the Revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight. At school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running. She had been a troopleader in the Spies and a branch secretary in the Youth League before joining the Junior Anti-Sex League. She had always borne an excellent character. She had even (an infallible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec, the sub-section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House by the people who worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like \'Spanking Stories\' or \'One Night in a Girls\' School\', to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal. \'What are these books like?\' said Winston curiously. \'Oh, ghastly rubbish.

The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory.

It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote: To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone — to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone: From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink — greetings!  35','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('98550097-a52d-4d97-9182-09639b64f69d','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',160,'Chapter 3 ^ We can come here once again,\' said Julia. \'It\'s generally safe to use any hide-out twice.

She became alert and business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about her waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemed natural to leave this to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London, stored away from innumerable community hikes. The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come, and brought him out at a different railway station. \'Never go home the same way as you went out,\' she said, as though enunciating an important general principle. She would leave first, and Winston was to wait half an hour before following her. She had named a place where they could meet after work, four evenings hence. It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewingthread.

Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface, its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing iniquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, to undermine! He pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face. \'Listen. The more men you\'ve had, the more I love you. Do you understand that?\' \'Yes, perfectly\' \'I hate purity, I hate goodness!

Not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces.

Will you understand, Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.

Moreover it was filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston\'s heart shrank. If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed. He felt certain that O\'Brien was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness. At this moment, however, O\'Brien turned away. He took a pace or two up and down.

It was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia and at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham: but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed. \'I thought we\'d always been at war with Eurasia,\' she said vaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth, but the switchover in the war had happened only four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as unimportant. \'Who cares?\' she said impatiently. \'It\'s always one bloody war after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway\' Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent forgeries that he committed there. Such things did not appear to horrify her. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becoming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his fingers. It did not make much impression on her.

They passed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. He did not touch the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was in his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. There was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporized, she might have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him. The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full.

The sun seemed to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her. Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour. Winston woke first. He sat up and watched the freckled face, still peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand. Except for her mouth, you could not call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes, if you looked closely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft. It occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived. The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying, protecting feeling. But the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back. He pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In the old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl\'s body and saw that it was desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.

He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous. Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed up. He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by two guards. \'Room 101,\' said the officer. The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not look at Winston either; he was looking only at the dials. He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things he had succeeded in holding back under the torture. He was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it already.

Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself.

Et il remarqua pour la première fois, avec\ncomme un frisson intérieur, mais sans savoir pourtant pourquoi il frissonnait,\nqu’Aaronson et Rutherford avaient tous deux le nez cassé.\nUn peu plus tard, tous trois furent\narrêtés. Il apparut qu’ils s’étaient engagés dans de nouvelles conspirations\ndès l’instant de leur libération. À leur second procès, ils confessèrent encore\nleurs anciens crimes ainsi que toute une suite de nouveaux. Ils furent exécutés\net leur vie fut consignée dans les annales du Parti, pour servir\nd’avertissement à la postérité.\nEnviron cinq ans après, en 1973,\nWinston déroulait une liasse de documents qui venait de tomber du tube\npneumatique sur son bureau quand il tomba sur un fragment de papier qui avait\nprobablement été glissé parmi les autres puis oublié. Il ne l’avait pas étalé\nque, déjà, il avait vu ce qu’il signifiait. C’était une demi-page déchirée d’un\nnuméro du Times d’il y avait dix ans – comme c’était la moitié supérieure de la\npage, elle portait la date. Cette page présentait une photo des délégués à une\nréunion du Parti qui se tenait à New York. Au milieu du groupe, on pouvait\nremarquer Jones, Aaronson et Rutherford. On ne pouvait se tromper. D’ailleurs\nleurs noms figuraient dans la légende, au-dessous de la photo.\nLe fait était qu’aux deux procès les\ntrois hommes avaient confessé qu’à cette date ils se trouvaient sur le sol\neurasien. Ils avaient pris l’avion à un aérodrome secret du Canada pour aller à\nun rendez-vous quelque part en Sibérie. Là, ils avaient conféré avec des\nmembres de l’état-major eurasien à qui ils avaient confié d’importants secrets\nmilitaires. La date s’était fixée dans la mémoire de Winston parce qu’il se\ntrouvait que, par hasard, c’était le jour de la Saint-Jean. Mais l’histoire\ncomplète devait se retrouver sur d’innombrables autres documents. Il n’y avait\nqu’une seule conclusion possible, les confessions étaient des mensonges.\nNaturellement, cette conclusion\nn’était pas en elle-même une découverte. Même à cette époque, Winston\nn’imaginait pas que les gens qui étaient anéantis au cours des épurations\navaient réellement commis les crimes dont on les accusait. Mais ceci était une\npreuve concrète. C’était un fragment du passé aboli. C’était le fossile qui,\ndécouvert dans une couche de terrain où on ne croyait pas le trouver, détruit\nune théorie géologique. Ce document, s’il avait pu être publié et expliqué,\naurait suffi pour faire sauter le Parti et le réduire en poussière.\nWinston avait continué à travailler.\nSitôt qu’il avait vu ce qu’était la photographie et ce qu’elle signifiait, il\nl’avait recouverte d’une autre feuille de papier. Heureusement, quand il\nl’avait déroulée, elle s’était trouvée à l’envers par rapport au télécran.\nIl posa son sous-main sur ses genoux\net recula sa chaise pour se placer aussi loin que possible du télécran. Garder\nun visage impassible n’était pas difficile et, avec un effort, on peut\ncontrôler jusqu’au rythme de sa respiration. Mais on ne peut maîtriser les\nbattements de son cœur et le télécran était assez sensible pour les relever.\nIl laissa passer, autant qu’il put\nen juger, dix minutes, pendant lesquelles il fut tourmenté par la crainte que\nne le trahisse quelque accident – un courant d’air inattendu, par exemple, qui\nsoufflerait sur son bureau. Ensuite, sans la découvrir, il jeta la photographie\navec d’autres vieux papiers dans le trou de mémoire. En moins d’une minute\npeut-être, elle avait dû être réduite en cendres.\nL’incident avait eu lieu dix, onze\nans plus tôt. Aujourd’hui, probablement, Winston aurait gardé la photographie.\nIl était curieux que le fait de l’avoir tenue entre ses doigts semblait\nconstituer pour lui une différence, même à cette heure où la photographie\nelle-même, aussi bien que l’événement qu’elle rappelait, n’était qu’un\nsouvenir. « L’emprise du Parti sur le passé était-elle moins forte, se\ndemanda-t-il, du fait qu’une pièce qui n’existait plus avait à un moment\nexisté ? »\nMais à l’heure actuelle, en\nsupposant qu’elle eût pu être, d’une manière quelconque ressuscitée de ses\ncendres, la photographie n’aurait même pas constitué une preuve.\nAu moment où Winston l’avait\ndécouverte, déjà l’Océania n’était plus en guerre contre l’Eurasia, et il\naurait fallu que ce fût en faveur des agents de l’Estasia que les trois hommes\ntrahissent leur pays. Depuis, il y avait eu d’autres changements. Deux ?\nTrois ? Winston ne pouvait se rappeler combien. Très probablement, les\nconfessions avaient été récrites et récrites encore, si bien que les faits et\ndates primitifs n’avaient plus la moindre signification. Le passé, non\nseulement changeait, mais changeait continuellement.\nCe qui affligeait le plus Winston et\nlui donnait une sensation de cauchemar, c’est qu’il n’avait jamais clairement\ncompris pourquoi cette colossale imposture était entreprise. Les avantages\nimmédiats tirés de la falsification du passé étaient évidents, mais le mobile\nfinal restait mystérieux. Il reprit sa plume et écrivit :\nJe comprends comment. Je ne comprends\npas pourquoi.\nIl se demanda, comme il l’avait fait\nplusieurs fois déjà, s’il n’était pas lui-même fou. Peut-être un fou n’était-il\nqu’une minorité réduite à l’unité. À une certaine époque, c’était un signe de\nfolie que de croire aux révolutions de la terre autour du soleil. Aujourd’hui,\nla folie était de croire que le passé était immuable. Peut-être était-il le\nseul à avoir cette croyance. S’il était le seul, il était donc fou. Mais la\npensée d’être fou ne le troublait pas beaucoup.

The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering — a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons — a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting — three hundred million people all with the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('9e288f80-2ba4-474e-9ea0-84a996b1ac18','2024-04-05 05:06:49','2024-04-05 05:06:49','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',18,' Le changement effectué, il\nn’aurait été possible en aucun cas de prouver qu’il y avait eu falsification.\nLa plus grande section du\nCommissariat aux Archives, bien plus grande que celle où travaillait Winston,\nétait simplement composée de gens dont la tâche était de rechercher et\nrassembler toutes les copies de livres, de journaux et autres documents qui\navaient été remplacées et qui devaient être détruites. Un numéro du Times\npouvait avoir été réécrit une douzaine de fois, soit par suite de changement\ndans la ligne politique, soit par suite d’erreurs dans les prophéties de Big\nBrother. Mais il se trouvait encore dans la collection avec sa date primitive.\nAucun autre exemplaire n’existait qui pût le contredire. Les livres aussi\nétaient retirés de la circulation et plusieurs fois réécrits. On les rééditait\nensuite sans aucune mention de modification. Même les instructions écrites que\nrecevait Winston et dont il se débarrassait invariablement dès qu’il n’en avait\nplus besoin, ne déclaraient ou n’impliquaient jamais qu’il s’agissait de faire\nun faux. Il était toujours fait mention de fautes, d’omissions, d’erreurs\ntypographiques, d’erreurs de citation, qu’il était nécessaire de corriger dans\nl’intérêt de l’exactitude.\nÀ proprement parler, il ne s’agit\nmême pas de falsification, pensa Winston tandis qu’il rajustait les chiffres du\nministère de l’Abondance. Il ne s’agit que de la substitution d’un non-sens à\nun autre. La plus grande partie du matériel dans lequel on trafiquait n’avait\naucun lien avec les données du monde réel, pas même cette sorte de lien que\ncontient le mensonge direct. Les statistiques étaient aussi fantaisistes dans\nleur version originale que dans leur version rectifiée. On comptait au premier\nchef sur les statisticiens eux-mêmes pour qu’ils ne s’en souvinssent plus.\nAinsi, le ministère de l’Abondance\navait, dans ses prévisions, estimé le nombre de bottes fabriquées dans le\ntrimestre à cent quarante-cinq millions de paires. Le chiffre indiqué par la\nproduction réelle était soixante-deux millions. Winston, cependant, en\nrécrivant les prévisions donna le chiffre de cinquante-sept millions, afin de\npermettre la déclaration habituelle que les prévisions avaient été dépassées.\nDans tous les cas, soixante-deux millions n’était pas plus près de la vérité\nque cinquante-sept millions ou que cent quarante-cinq millions. Très\nprobablement, personne ne savait combien, dans l’ensemble, on en avait\nfabriqué. Il se pouvait également que pas une seule n’ait été fabriquée. Et\npersonne, en réalité, ne s’en souciait. Tout ce qu’on savait, c’est qu’à chaque\ntrimestre un nombre astronomique de bottes étaient produites, sur le papier, alors\nque la moitié peut-être de la population de l’Océania marchait pieds nus.\nIl en était de même pour le report\ndes faits de tous ordres, qu’ils fussent importants ou insignifiants. Tout\ns’évanouissait dans une ombre dans laquelle, finalement, la date même de\nl’année devenait incertaine.\nWinston jeta un coup d’œil à travers\nla galerie. De l’autre côté, dans la cabine correspondant à la sienne, un petit\nhomme d’aspect méticuleux, au menton bleui, nommé Tillotson, travaillait avec\nardeur. Il avait un journal plié sur les genoux et sa bouche était placée tout\ncontre l’embouchure du phonoscript, comme s’il essayait de garder secret entre\nle télécran et lui ce qu’il disait. Il leva les yeux et ses verres lancèrent un\néclair hostile dans la direction de Winston.\nWinston connaissait à peine\nTillotson et n’avait aucune idée de la nature du travail auquel il était\nemployé. Les gens du Commissariat aux Archives ne parlaient pas volontiers de\nleur travail. Dans la longue galerie sans fenêtres où l’on voyait une double\nrangée de cabines où l’on entendait un éternel bruit de papier froissé et le\nbourdonnement continu des voix qui murmuraient dans les phonoscripts, il y\navait bien une douzaine de personnes. Winston ne savait même pas leurs noms,\nbien qu’il les vît chaque jour se dépêcher dans un sens ou dans l’autre dans\nles couloirs ou gesticuler pendant les Deux Minutes de la Haine.\nIl savait que, dans la cabine\nvoisine de la sienne, la petite femme rousse peinait, un jour dans l’autre, à\nrechercher dans la presse et à éliminer les noms des gens qui avaient été\nvaporisés et qui étaient par conséquent, considérés comme n’ayant jamais\nexisté. Il y avait là un certain à-propos puisque son propre mari, deux ans\nplus tôt, avait été vaporisé.\nQuelques cabines plus loin, se trouvait\nune créature douce, effacée, rêveuse, nommée Ampleforth, qui avait du poil\nplein les oreilles et possédait un talent surprenant pour jongler avec les\nrimes et les mètres. Cet Ampleforth était employé à produire des versions\ninexactes – on les appelait « textes définitifs » – de poèmes qui\nétaient devenus idéologiquement offensants mais que pour une raison ou pour une\nautre, on devrait conserver dans les anthologies.\nEt cette galerie, avec ses cinquante\nemployés environ, n’était qu’une sous-section, un seul élément, en somme, de\nl’infinie complexité du Commissariat aux Archives. Plus loin, au-dessus,\nau-dessous, il y avait d’autres essaims de travailleurs engagés dans une\nmultitude inimaginable d’activités.\nIl y avait les immenses ateliers\nd’impression, avec leurs sous-éditeurs, leurs experts typographes, leurs\nstudios soigneusement équipés pour le truquage des photographies. Il y avait la\nsection des programmes de télévision, avec ses ingénieurs, ses producteurs, ses\néquipes d’acteurs spécialement choisis pour leur habileté à imiter les voix. Il\ny avait les armées d’archivistes dont le travail consistait simplement à\ndresser les listes des livres et des périodiques qu’il fallait retirer de la\ncirculation. Il y avait les vastes archives où étaient classés les documents\ncorrigés et les fournaises cachées où les copies originales étaient détruites.\nEt quelque part, absolument anonymes, il y avait les cerveaux directeurs qui\ncoordonnaient tous les efforts et établissaient la ligne politique qui ','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('9ebede6e-b635-4632-952a-90903fd5c3bd','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',256,'and aristocrats and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had always made use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity Now, however, the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In the past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand. Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages. But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned. The new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating UNfreedom and INequality These new movements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology. But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more, and then stop.

He seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe. He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations — that they lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years ago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. The Party claimed, for example, that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate: before the Revolution, it was said, the number had only been 15 per cent. The Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300 — and so it went on. It was like a single equation with two unknowns. It might very well be that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one accepted without question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there might never have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat. Everything faded into mist.

Winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes. \'It was a good hanging,\' said Syme reminiscently \'I think it spoils it when they tie their feet together. I like to see them kicking. And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue — a quite bright blue. That\'s the detail that appeals to me.\' \'Nex\', please!\' yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle. Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On to each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch — a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew, a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and one saccharine tablet. \"There\'s a table over there, under that telescreen,\' said Syme. \'Let\'s pick up a gin on the way\' The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat.

He pulled her closer against him. Her head rested on his shoulder, the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung. She was very young, he thought, she still expected something from life, she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing. \'Actually it would have made no difference,\' he said. \"Then why are you sorry you didn\'t do it?\' \'Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we\'re playing, we can\'t win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds, that\'s all.\' He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind. She would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated. In a way she realized that she herself was doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would catch her and kill her, but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose. All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. She did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from the moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse. \'We are the dead,\' he said. 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('9fcd1816-c05e-4a1a-b530-27352e2374cf','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',338,'and worse.

Every day, at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible — and in the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power.

He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of Big Brother\'s head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by his daughter\'s troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racket of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just once he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room. She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not look in that direction again. The afternoon was morebearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under a cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible to think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at the Community Centre.

O\'Brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round the face. \'I told you,\' said O\'Brien, \'that if we met again it would be here.\' \'Yes,\' said Winston. Without any warning except a slight movement of O\'Brien\'s hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. It was a frightening pain, because he could not see what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening, or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible. \'You are afraid,\' said O\'Brien, watching his face, \'that in another moment something is going to break. Your especial fear is that it will be your backbone. You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them.

Her face had turned a milky yellow. The smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath. \'You are the dead,\' repeated the iron voice. \'It was behind the picture,\' breathed Julia. \'It was behind the picture,\' said the voice. \'Remain exactly where you are. Make no movement until you are ordered.\' It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do nothing except stand gazing into one another\'s eyes. To run for life, to get out of the house before it was too late — no such thought occurred to them. Unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catch had been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture had fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it. \'Now they can see us,\' said Julia. \'Now we can see you,\' said the voice. \'Stand out in the middle of the room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands behind your heads. Do not touch one another.\' They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia\'s body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. He could just stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control. There was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside. The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was being dragged across the stones. The woman\'s singing had stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling clang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain. \"The house is surrounded,\' said Winston.

And in a small stationer\'s shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink. He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn, pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had already been middleaged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a prole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into Winston\'s mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him. He would say to him: \'Tell me about your life when you were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things better than they are now, or were they worse?\' 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('a19f3907-f4c6-49bc-b5d0-74a2fac42b65','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',44,'surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death? The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed — if all records told the same tale — then the lie passed into history and became truth. \'Who controls the past,\' ran the Party slogan, \'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\' And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple.

What was needed was a piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order for the Day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file Party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence. Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in Big Brother\'s familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them (\'What lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades? The lesson — which is also one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc — that,\' etc., etc.), easy to imitate. At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. At six — a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules — he had joined the Spies, at nine he had been a troop leader. At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex League. At nineteen he had designed a hand-grenade which had been adopted by the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, had killed thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst.

Almost in the same instant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body. The pain was already half-forgotten. He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O\'Brien. At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on O\'Brien\'s arm. He had never loved him so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. The old feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O\'Brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back. O\'Brien was a person who could be talked to. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O\'Brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place where they could meet and talk. O\'Brien was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind. When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone. \'Do you know where you are, Winston?\' he said. \'I don\'t know. I can guess.

You must know all the while that it is there, but until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that could be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think right; he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst. One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. It was always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be enough. In that time the world inside him could turn over. And then suddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without the changing of a line in his face — suddenly the camouflage would be down and bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, or too early. They would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would be unpunished, unrepented, out of their reach for ever.

They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibnum, however far it is pushed one way or the other \'Julia, are you awake?\' said Winston. \'Yes, my love, I\'m listening. Go on. It\'s marvellous.\' He continued reading: The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim — for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives — is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again.

Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment. All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods. But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever power controls equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, or Southern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies. The inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas.

He turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught him gently by the arm. \'May I offer you a drink?\' he said. \'You\'re a gent,\' said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He appeared not to have noticed Winston\'s blue overalls. \'Pint!\' he added aggressively to the barman. \'Pint of wallop.\' The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets. Winston\'s presence was forgotten for a moment. There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in. \"E could \'a drawed me off a pint,\' grumbled the old man as he settled down behind a glass. \'A \'alf litre ain\'t enough.

Some days he believed in it, some days not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls — once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O\'Brien again. The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one had to live. Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin was rising from his stomach. His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. And it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals— DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER over and over again, filling half a page. He could not help feeling a twinge of panic.

Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote: April 4th, 1984. He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two. For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless. For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had changed over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the pow1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('a83a9c06-9266-48f1-b529-aadebf1d20f7','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',11,'er of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the ginSuddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down.

A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It had no caption, and represented simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier, three or four metres high, striding forward with expressionless Mongolian face and enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From whatever angle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified by the foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. The thing had been plastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother. The proles, normally apathetic about the war, were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism. As though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual. One fell on a crowded film theatre in Stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. The whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long, trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting. Another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces. There were further angry demonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('a95d9407-ec18-48c0-9bee-9e5995a2ad33','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',118,'vivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long- dead sister\'s face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and written records were falsified — when that happened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested. At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and looked up. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed among dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung three discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shop where he had bought the diary. A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the place again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary. At the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open.

Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes. That was ten — eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party\'s hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer HAD ONCE existed? But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when he made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country. Since then there had been other changes — two, three, he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance. The past not only changed, but changed continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken. The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote: / understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.

He knew, with more certainty than before, that O\'Brien was on his side. He was writing the diary for O\'Brien — TO O\'Brien: it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed to a particular person and took its colour from that fact. The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command. His heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall towards the earth\'s centre.

Since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from O\'Brien, it was not easy to say why he had come here.

Actually, when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. The truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it.

Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is. They could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the level of popular education is actually declining.

We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution.

It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from the cheekbones.

The terror that Winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake. For what evidence had he in reality that O\'Brien was any kind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on a dream. He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary, because in that case Julia\'s presence was impossible to explain. As O\'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike him. He stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap. The voice had stopped. Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. Even in the midst of his panic, Winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue. \'You can turn it off!\' he said. \'Yes,\' said O\'Brien, \'we can turn it off. We have that privilege.\' He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over the pair of them, and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. He was waiting, somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it was quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O\'Brien\'s.

He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. The bonds that had held his body down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably, his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For a moment he clung to O\'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders. He had the feeling that O\'Brien was his protector, that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source, and that it was O\'Brien who would save him from it. \'You are a slow learner, Winston,\' said O\'Brien gently. \'How can I help it?\' he blubbered. \'How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.\' Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.\' He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold. O\'Brien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings.

But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.

Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing close attention. Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political meaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One, much the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had feared. He did not know why the Thought Police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description. But there was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come from the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground organization. Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it!

Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from childhood onwards. There were even organizations such as the Junior Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. All children were to be begotten by artificial insemination (ARTSEM, it was called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party. The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it. He did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. And as far as the women were concerned, the Party\'s efforts were largely successful. He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten — nearly eleven years since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of her. For days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married. They had only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did not permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children. Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it.

The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his pen half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary. Suddenly he began thinking of O\'Brien again. Years ago — how long was it? Seven years it must be — he had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark room. And someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed: \'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.\' It was said very quietly, almost casually — a statement, not a command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen O\'Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as O\'Brien\'s. But at any rate the identification existed. It was O\'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark. Winston had never been able to feel sure — even after this morning\'s flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O\'Brien was a friend or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link of understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship. \'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,\' he had said. Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it would come true. 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('b19eda76-a6d6-46fd-a3ba-a1010d7565b1','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',182,'side of it there was something unendurable, something too dreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self-deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness. With a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. He always woke up without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with what Julia had been saying when he cut her short. \'I\'m sorry\' he said, \'it\'s nothing. I don\'t like rats, that\'s all\' \'Don\'t worry, dear, we\'re not going to have the filthy brutes in here. I\'ll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go. And next time we come here I\'ll bring some plaster and bung it up properly\' Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. What was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine. With one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other, Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining the absurd twelve1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('b24f673f-bfab-4e92-b300-89749978162a','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',348,'could walk three kilometres, measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he could not do. He could not move out of a walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm\'s length, he could not stand on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on his heels, and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands. It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre. But after a few more days — a few more mealtimes — even that feat was accomplished. A time came when he could do it six times running. He began to grow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal. Only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror. His mind grew more active. He sat down on the plank bed, his back against the wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work deliberately at the task of re-educating himself. He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw now, he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. From the moment when he was inside the Ministry of Love — and yes, even during those minutes when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to do — he had grasped the frivolity, the shallowness of his attempt to set himself 348 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('b253c6ee-ecaa-4995-9937-0fd0b4a96bcd','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',38,'were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things. He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, are a continuation of one\'s intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mother\'s death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason. His mother\'s memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking. 38 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('b2550dad-190c-42c0-9fb6-ef32fe6ac8ea','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',63,'tried all over the place.

The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he turned and faced Syme again. Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter. \'Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?\' said Syme. \'I was working,\' said Winston indifferently. \'I shall see it on the flicks, I suppose.\' A very inadequate substitute,\' said Syme. His mocking eyes roved over Winston\'s face. \'I know you,\' the eyes seemed to say, \'I see through you. I know very well why you didn\'t go to see those prisoners hanged.\' In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously orthodox.

Mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted of sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen. Each time that Winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he crawled back sticky- eyed and aching, it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so that the first job was always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work. What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.

It was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. There were telescreens all round the pediment. But at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush. Winston followed. As he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing. Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square. Winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm\'s length of the girl, but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he had broken through, sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.

But there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored. It is; WHY should human equality be averted? Supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described, what is the motive for this huge, accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time? Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen, the mystique of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, depends upon DOUBLETHINK But deeper than this lies the original motive, the never- questioned instinct that first led to the seizure of power and brought DOUBLETHINK, the Thought Police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards. This motive really consists... Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware of a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been very still for some time past.

Winston\'s heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the front; instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming. All day, with little spurts of excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of his mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to outflank them in some way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly in his mind. He picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. THERE was the proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear, cutting their comunications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence. But it was necessary to act quickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa, if they had airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. It might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the destruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary medley of feeling — but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successive layers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was undermost — struggled inside him. The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its place, but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem. His thoughts wandered again. Almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table: 366 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('b4706eda-63a8-4710-8b75-da487ed70286','2024-04-05 05:09:50','2024-04-05 05:09:50','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',1,'1984: Traduit de l’anglais par Amélie Audiberti','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('b47ec59b-4ffd-4a4f-b8f8-f4c5f450f3aa','2024-04-05 05:06:49','2024-04-05 05:06:49','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',22,' Vous croyez,\nn’est-ce pas, que notre travail principal est d’inventer des mots nouveaux ?\nPas du tout ! Nous détruisons chaque jour des mots, des vingtaines de\nmots, des centaines de mots. Nous taillons le langage jusqu’à l’os. La onzième\nédition ne renfermera pas un seul mot qui puisse vieillir avant\nl’année 2050.\nIl mordit dans son pain avec\nappétit, avala deux bouchées, puis continua à parler avec une sorte de\npédantisme passionné. Son mince visage brun s’était animé, ses yeux avaient\nperdu leur expression moqueuse et étaient devenus rêveurs.\n— C’est une belle chose, la\ndestruction des mots. Naturellement, c’est dans les verbes et les adjectifs\nqu’il y a le plus de déchets, mais il y a des centaines de noms dont on peut\naussi se débarrasser. Pas seulement les synonymes, il y a aussi les antonymes.\nAprès tout, quelle raison d’exister y a-t-il pour un mot qui n’est que le\ncontraire d’un autre ? Les mots portent en eux-mêmes leur contraire.\nPrenez « bon », par exemple. Si vous avez un mot comme\n« bon » quelle nécessité y a-t-il à avoir un mot comme « mauvais » ?\n« Inbon » fera tout aussi bien, mieux même, parce qu’il est l’opposé\nexact de bon, ce que n’est pas l’autre mot. Et si l’on désire un mot plus fort\nque « bon », quel sens y a-t-il à avoir toute une chaîne de mots\nvagues et inutiles comme « excellent », « splendide » et\ntout le reste ? « Plusbon » englobe le sens de tous ces mots,\net, si l’on veut un mot encore plus fort, il y a « double-plusbon ».\nNaturellement, nous employons déjà ces formes, mais dans la version définitive\ndu novlangue, il n’y aura plus rien d’autre. En résumé, la notion complète du\nbon et du mauvais sera couverte par six mots seulement, en réalité un seul mot.\nVoyez-vous, Winston, l’originalité de cela ? Naturellement, ajouta-t-il\naprès coup, l’idée vient de Big Brother.\nAu nom de Big Brother, une sorte\nd’ardeur froide flotta sur le visage de Winston. Syme, néanmoins, perçut\nimmédiatement un certain manque d’enthousiasme.\n— Vous n’appréciez pas\nréellement le novlangue, Winston, dit-il presque tristement. Même quand vous\nécrivez, vous pensez en ancilangue. J’ai lu quelques-uns des articles que vous\nécrivez parfois dans le Times. Ils sont assez bons, mais ce sont des\ntraductions. Au fond, vous auriez préféré rester fidèle à l’ancien langage, à\nson imprécision et ses nuances inutiles. Vous ne saisissez pas la beauté qu’il y\na dans la destruction des mots. Savez-vous que le novlangue est la seule langue\ndont le vocabulaire diminue chaque année ?\nWinston l’ignorait, naturellement.\nIl sourit avec sympathie, du moins il l’espérait, car il n’osait se risquer à\nparler.\nSyme prit une autre bouchée de pain\nnoir, la mâcha rapidement et continua :\n— Ne voyez-vous pas que le\nvéritable but du novlangue est de restreindre les limites de la pensée ? À\nla fin, nous rendrons littéralement impossible le crime par la pensée car il\nn’y aura plus de mots pour l’exprimer. Tous les concepts nécessaires seront\nexprimés chacun exactement par un seul mot dont le sens sera délimité. Toutes\nles significations subsidiaires seront supprimées et oubliées. Déjà, dans la\nonzième édition, nous ne sommes pas loin de ce résultat. Mais le processus\ncontinuera encore longtemps après que vous et moi nous serons morts. Chaque\nannée, de moins en moins de mots, et le champ de la conscience de plus en plus\nrestreint. Il n’y a plus, dès maintenant, c’est certain, d’excuse ou de raison\nau crime par la pensée. C’est simplement une question de discipline\npersonnelle, de maîtrise de soi-même. Mais même cette discipline sera inutile\nen fin de compte. La Révolution sera complète quand le langage sera parfait. Le\nnovlangue est l’angsoc et l’angsoc est le novlangue, ajouta-t-il avec une sorte\nde satisfaction mystique. Vous est-il jamais arrivé de penser, Winston, qu’en\nl’année 2050, au plus tard, il n’y aura pas un seul être humain vivant\ncapable de comprendre une conversation comme celle que nous tenons\nmaintenant ?\n— Sauf…, commença Winston avec\nun accent dubitatif, mais il s’interrompit.\nIl avait sur le bout de la langue\nles mots : « Sauf les prolétaires », mais il se maîtrisa. Il\nn’était pas absolument certain que cette remarque fût tout à fait orthodoxe.\nSyme, cependant, avait deviné ce qu’il allait dire.\n— Les prolétaires ne sont pas\ndes êtres humains, dit-il négligemment. Vers 2050, plus tôt probablement, toute\nconnaissance de l’ancienne langue aura disparu. Toute la littérature du passé\naura été détruite. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron n’existeront plus qu’en\nversions novlangue. Ils ne seront pas changés simplement en quelque chose de\ndifférent, ils seront changés en quelque chose qui sera le contraire de ce\nqu’ils étaient jusque-là. Même la littérature du Parti changera. Même les\nslogans changeront. Comment pourrait-il y avoir une devise comme « La\nliberté c’est l’esclavage » alors que le concept même de la liberté aura\nété aboli ? Le climat total de la pensée sera autre. En fait, il n’y aura\npas de pensée telle que nous la comprenons maintenant. Orthodoxie signifie\nnon-pensant, qui n’a pas besoin de pensée, l’orthodoxie, c’est l’inconscience.\n« Un de ces jours, pensa\nsoudain Winston avec une conviction certaine, Syme sera vaporisé. Il est trop\nintelligent. Il voit trop clairement et parle trop franchement. Le Parti n’aime\npas ces individus-là. Un jour, il disparaîtra. C’est écrit sur son\nvisage. »\nWinston avait fini son pain et son\nfromage. Il se tourna un peu de côté sur sa chaise pour boire son café. À la\ntable qui se trouvait à sa gauche, l’homme à la voix stridente continuait\nimpitoyablement à parler. Une jeune femme, qui était peut-être sa secrétaire et\nqui tournait le dos à Winston, l’écoutait et semblait approuver avec ardeur\ntout ce qu’il disait. De temps en temps, Winston saisissait quelques remarques\ncomme « Je pense que vous avez raison à un tel point ! »,\n« Si vous saviez comme je vous approuve », émises d’une voix féminine\njeune et plutôt sotte.

There was a strip of carpet on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chair drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it. \'We lived here till my wife died,\' said the old man half apologetically. \'I\'m selling the furniture off by little and little. Now that\'s a beautiful mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it. But I dare say you\'d find it a little bit cumbersome.\' He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thought flitted through Winston\'s mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an armchair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock. \'There\'s no telescreen!\' he could not help murmuring. \'Ah,\' said the old man, \'I never had one of those things. Too expensive. And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow.

Perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain. The conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outer edges of it. He knew that sooner or later he would obey O\'Brien\'s summons. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay— he was not certain. What was happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years ago. The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words, and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the beginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was like a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even while he was speaking to O\'Brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.

Winston connaissait l’homme de vue. Tout ce qu’il savait, c’est qu’il\noccupait un poste important au Commissariat aux Romans. C’était un homme\nd’environ trente ans, au cou musclé, à la bouche large et frémissante. Sa tête\nétait légèrement rejetée en arrière et, à cause de l’angle sous lequel il était\nassis, ses lunettes réfractaient la lumière et présentaient, à la place des\nyeux, deux disques vides. Ce qui était légèrement horrible, c’est qu’il était\npresque impossible de distinguer un seul mot du flot de paroles qui se\ndéversait de sa bouche. Une fois seulement, Winston perçut une phrase\n(« complète et finale élimination de Goldstein ») lancée brusquement,\navec volubilité et d’un bloc, semblait-il, comme une ligne de caractères\ntypographiques composée pleine. Le reste n’était qu’un bruit, qu’un caquetage.\nPourtant, bien qu’on ne pût entendre, on ne pouvait avoir aucun doute sur la\nnature générale de ce que disait l’homme. Peut-être dénonçait-il Goldstein et\ndemandait-il des mesures plus sévères contre les criminels par la pensée et les\nsaboteurs ; peut-être fulminait-il contre les atrocités de l’armée\neurasienne ; peut-être encore glorifiait-il Big Brother et les héros du\nfront de Malabar. Peu importait. Quel que fût le sujet de sa conversation, on\npouvait être sûr que tous les mots en étaient d’une pure orthodoxie, d’un pur\nangsoc.\nTandis qu’il regardait le visage\nsans yeux dont la mâchoire manœuvrait rapidement dans le sens vertical, Winston\navait l’étrange impression que cet homme n’était pas un être humain réel, mais\nquelque chose comme un mannequin articulé : ce n’était pas le cerveau de\nl’homme qui s’exprimait, c’était son larynx. La substance qui sortait de lui\nétait faite de mots, mais ce n’était pas du langage dans le vrai sens du terme.\nC’était un bruit émis en état d’inconscience, comme le caquetage d’un canard.\nSyme, depuis un moment, était\nsilencieux et traçait des dessins avec le manche de sa cuiller dans la flaque\nde ragoût. La voix, à l’autre table, continuait son caquetage volubile,\naisément audible en dépit du vacarme environnant.\n— Il y a un mot en novlangue,\ndit Syme, je ne sais si vous le connaissez : canelangue, « caquetage\ndu canard ». C’est un de ces mots intéressants qui ont deux sens opposés.\nAppliqué à un adversaire, c’est une insulte. Adressé à quelqu’un avec qui l’on\nest d’accord, c’est un éloge.\n« Indubitablement, Syme sera\nvaporisé », pensa de nouveau Winston. Il le pensa avec une sorte de\ntristesse, bien qu’il sût que Syme le méprisait et éprouvait pour lui une\nlégère antipathie. Syme était parfaitement capable de le dénoncer comme\ncriminel par la pensée s’il voyait une raison quelconque de le faire. Il y\navait quelque chose qui clochait subtilement chez Syme. Quelque chose lui manquait.\nIl manquait de discrétion, de réserve, d’une sorte de stupidité restrictive. On\nne pouvait dire qu’il ne fût pas orthodoxe. Il croyait aux principes de\nl’angsoc, il vénérait Big Brother, il se réjouissait des victoires, il\ndétestait les hérétiques, et pas simplement avec sincérité, mais avec une sorte\nde zèle incessant, un savoir chaque jour révisé dont n’approchaient pas les\nmembres ordinaires du Parti. Cependant, une équivoque et bizarre atmosphère\ns’attachait à lui. Il disait des choses qu’il aurait mieux valu taire, il avait\nlu trop de livres, il fréquentait le café du Châtaignier, rendez-vous de\npeintres et de musiciens. Il n’y avait pas de loi, même pas de loi verbale, qui\ndéfendît de fréquenter le café du Châtaignier, cependant, y aller constituait\nen quelque sorte un mauvais présage. Les vieux meneurs discrédités du Parti\navaient l’habitude de se réunir là avant qu’ils fussent finalement emportés par\nl’épuration. Goldstein lui-même, disait-on, avait parfois été vu là, il y avait\ndes dizaines d’années. Le sort de Syme n’était pas difficile à prévoir.\nC’était un fait, pourtant, que s’il\nsoupçonnait, ne fût-ce que trois secondes, la nature des opinions de Winston,\nil le dénoncerait instantanément à la Police de la Pensée. Ainsi, d’ailleurs,\nferait n’importe qui, mais Syme, plus sûrement que tout autre. Ce zèle,\ncependant, était insuffisant. La suprême orthodoxie était l’inconscience.\nSyme leva les yeux. « Voilà\nParsons », dit-il.\nQuelque chose dans le son de sa voix\nsembla ajouter : « Ce bougre d’imbécile. »\nParsons, colocataire de Winston au\nbloc de la Victoire, se faufilait en effet à travers la salle. C’était un gros\nhomme de taille moyenne, aux cheveux blonds et au visage de grenouille. À\ntrente-cinq ans, il prenait déjà de la graisse et montrait des rouleaux au cou\net à la taille, mais ses gestes étaient vifs et puérils. Toute son apparence\nrappelait celle d’un petit garçon trop poussé, si bien qu’en dépit de la\ncombinaison réglementaire qu’il portait, il était presque impossible de\nl’imaginer autrement que vêtu du short bleu, de la chemise grise et du foulard\nrouge des Espions. Lorsqu’on l’évoquait, on se représentait toujours des genoux\nà fossettes et des manches roulées sur des avant-bras dodus. Parsons, en fait,\nrevenait invariablement au short chaque fois qu’une sortie collective ou une\nautre activité physique lui en fournissait le prétexte.\nIl les salua tous deux d’un joyeux\n« holà ! » et s’assit à leur table. Il dégageait une forte odeur\nde sueur. Des gouttes recouvraient tout son visage rosé. Son pouvoir de\ntranspiration était extraordinaire. Au Centre communautaire, on pouvait\ntoujours, par l’humidité du manche de la raquette, savoir s’il avait joué au\nping-pong.\nSyme avait sorti une bande de papier\nsur laquelle il y avait une longue colonne de mots et il étudiait, un crayon à\nencre à la main.\n— Regardez-le travailler à\nl’heure du déjeuner, dit Parsons en poussant Winston du coude.

The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. His mind went back to another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy whitequilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water. He told Julia the story of his mother\'s disappearance. Without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position. \'I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,\' she said indistinctly. \'All children are swine.\' \'Yes. But the real point of the story  \' From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again. He would have liked to continue talking about his mother. He did not suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be altered from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. When the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in her arms.

O\'Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his left Winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe. O\'Brien turned to Winston with a smile. In almost the old manner he resettled his spectacles on his nose. \'Do you remember writing in your diary\' he said, \'that it did not matter whether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane.

Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, but Winston\'s standards in such matters were not high. He had never before seen or imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. The improvement in her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour in the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above all, far more feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils. He remembered the half- darkness of a basement kitchen, and a woman\'s cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent that she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter. \'Scent too!\' he said. \'Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I\'m going to do next?

Science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly regimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, and various devices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage, have been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped, and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.

Les horloges sonnaient treize heures. Winston Smith, le menton rentré\ndans le cou, s’efforçait d’éviter le vent mauvais. Il passa rapidement la porte\nvitrée du bloc des « Maisons de la Victoire », pas assez rapidement\ncependant pour empêcher que s’engouffre en même temps que lui un tourbillon de\npoussière et de sable.\nLe hall sentait le chou cuit et le\nvieux tapis. À l’une de ses extrémités, une affiche de couleur, trop vaste pour\nce déploiement intérieur, était clouée au mur. Elle représentait simplement un\nénorme visage, large de plus d’un mètre : le visage d’un homme d’environ\nquarante-cinq ans, à l’épaisse moustache noire, aux traits accentués et beaux.\nWinston se dirigea vers l’escalier.\nIl était inutile d’essayer de prendre l’ascenseur. Même aux meilleures époques,\nil fonctionnait rarement. Actuellement, d’ailleurs, le courant électrique était\ncoupé dans la journée. C’était une des mesures d’économie prises en vue de la\nSemaine de la Haine.\nSon appartement était au septième.\nWinston, qui avait trente-neuf ans et souffrait d’un ulcère variqueux au-dessus\nde la cheville droite, montait lentement. Il s’arrêta plusieurs fois en chemin\npour se reposer. À chaque palier, sur une affiche collée au mur, face à la cage\nde l’ascenseur, l’énorme visage vous fixait du regard. C’était un de ces\nportraits arrangés de telle sorte que les yeux semblent suivre celui qui passe.\nUne légende, sous le portrait, disait : BIG BROTHER VOUS REGARDE.\nÀ l’intérieur de l’appartement de\nWinston, une voix sucrée faisait entendre une série de nombres qui avaient\ntrait à la production de la fonte. La voix provenait d’une plaque de métal\noblongue, miroir terne encastré dans le mur de droite. Winston tourna un bouton\net la voix diminua de volume, mais les mots étaient encore distincts. Le son de\nl’appareil (du télécran, comme on disait) pouvait être assourdi, mais il n’y\navait aucun moyen de l’éteindre complètement. Winston se dirigea vers la\nfenêtre. Il était de stature frêle, plutôt petite, et sa maigreur était soulignée\npar la combinaison bleue, uniforme du Parti. Il avait les cheveux très blonds,\nle visage naturellement sanguin, la peau durcie par le savon grossier, les\nlames de rasoir émoussées et le froid de l’hiver qui venait de prendre fin.\nAu-dehors, même à travers le carreau\nde la fenêtre fermée, le monde paraissait froid. Dans la rue, de petits remous\nde vent faisaient tourner en spirale la poussière et le papier déchiré. Bien\nque le soleil brillât et que le ciel fût d’un bleu dur, tout semblait décoloré,\nhormis les affiches collées partout. De tous les carrefours importants, le\nvisage à la moustache noire vous fixait du regard. Il y en avait un sur le mur\nd’en face. BIG BROTHER VOUS REGARDE, répétait la légende, tandis que le regard\ndes yeux noirs pénétrait les yeux de Winston. Au niveau de la rue, une autre\naffiche, dont un angle était déchiré, battait par à-coups dans le vent,\ncouvrant et découvrant alternativement un seul mot : ANGSOC. Au loin, un\nhélicoptère glissa entre les toits, plana un moment, telle une mouche bleue,\npuis repartit comme une flèche, dans un vol courbe. C’était une patrouille qui\nvenait mettre le nez aux fenêtres des gens. Mais les patrouilles n’avaient pas\nd’importance. Seule comptait la Police de la Pensée.\nDerrière Winston, la voix du télécran\ncontinuait à débiter des renseignements sur la fonte et sur le dépassement des\nprévisions pour le neuvième plan triennal. Le télécran recevait et transmettait\nsimultanément. Il captait tous les sons émis par Winston au-dessus d’un\nchuchotement très bas. De plus, tant que Winston demeurait dans le champ de\nvision de la plaque de métal, il pouvait être vu aussi bien qu’entendu.\nNaturellement, il n’y avait pas moyen de savoir si, à un moment donné, on était\nsurveillé. Combien de fois, et suivant quel plan, la Police de la Pensée se\nbranchait-elle sur une ligne individuelle quelconque, personne ne pouvait le\nsavoir. On pouvait même imaginer qu’elle surveillait tout le monde,\nconstamment. Mais de toute façon, elle pouvait mettre une prise sur votre ligne\nchaque fois qu’elle le désirait. On devait vivre, on vivait, car l’habitude\ndevient instinct, en admettant que tout son émis était entendu et que, sauf\ndans l’obscurité, tout mouvement était perçu.\nWinston restait le dos tourné au\ntélécran. Bien qu’un dos, il le savait, pût être révélateur, c’était plus\nprudent. À un kilomètre, le ministère de la Vérité, où il travaillait,\ns’élevait vaste et blanc au-dessus du paysage sinistre. Voilà Londres,\npensa-t-il avec une sorte de vague dégoût, Londres, capitale de la Première\nRégion Aérienne, la troisième, par le chiffre de sa population, des provinces\nde l’Océania. Il essaya d’extraire de sa mémoire quelque souvenir d’enfance qui\nlui indiquerait si Londres avait toujours été tout à fait comme il la voyait. Y\navait-il toujours eu ces perspectives de maisons du XIXe siècle en\nruine, ces murs étayés par des poutres, ce carton aux fenêtres pour remplacer\nles vitres, ces toits plâtrés de tôle ondulée, ces clôtures de jardin délabrées\net penchées dans tous les sens ? Y avait-il eu toujours ces emplacements\nbombardés où la poussière de plâtre tourbillonnait, où l’épilobe grimpait sur\ndes monceaux de décombres ? Et ces endroits où les bombes avaient dégagé\nun espace plus large et où avaient jailli de sordides colonies d’habitacles en\nbois semblables à des cabanes à lapins ? Mais c’était inutile, Winston\nn’arrivait pas à se souvenir. Rien ne lui restait de son enfance, hors une\nsérie de tableaux brillamment éclairés, sans arrière-plan et absolument\ninintelligibles.\nLe ministère de la Vérité – Miniver,\nen novlangue[1]\n– frappait par sa différence avec les objets environnants. C’était une\ngigantesque construction pyramidale de béton d’un blanc éclatant.

A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long, brightly- lit corridor. It was the girl with dark hair. Four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop. As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were \'roughed in\'. It was a common accident in the Fiction Department. They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain. A curious emotion stirred in Winston\'s heart. In front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively started forward  133','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('baecee1b-5325-4639-9db8-d909f05538f3','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',235,'it, the Japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet. In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. War, however, is no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference This is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are committed by one\'s own side and not by the enemy, meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few casualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round the Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths.

The head of a ladder had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. Someone was climbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs. The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with ironshod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands. Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. One thing alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you! A man with a smooth prize-fighter\'s jowl in which the mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon meditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met his eyes. The feeling of nakedness, with one\'s hands behind one\'s head and one\'s face and body all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man protruded the tip of a white tongue, licked the place where his lips should have been, and then passed on. There was another crash.

She stood before him very upright, with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act. The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to have fallen of their own accord. He took her hand. \'Would you believe,\' he said, \'that till this moment I didn\'t know what colour your eyes were?\' They were brown, he noted, a rather light shade of brown, with dark lashes. \'Now that you\'ve seen what I\'m really like, can you still bear to look at me?\' \'Yes, easily\' \'I\'m thirty-nine years old.

The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his his arms. At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. The youthful body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against his face, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her down on to the ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her. But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere contact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was happening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without women — he did not know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled  151','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('bd326e6e-fcc5-4baf-907f-513dd8ff98f8','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',108,'sawdust, and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a folded- up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder. Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces, Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows. \'Can\'t you bleeding well listen to what I say?

It isn\'t only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take \'good\', for instance. If you have a word like \'good\', what need is there for a word like \'bad\'? \'Ungood\' will do just as well — better, because it\'s an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of \'good\', what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like \'excellent\' and \'splendid\' and all the rest of them? \'Plusgood\' covers the meaning, or \'doubleplusgood\' if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already, but in the final version of Newspeak there\'ll be nothing else.

They could have lain down on the ground and done THAT if they had wanted to. His flesh froze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew now what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosion of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stone than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been. He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they walked back across the grass, she looked directly at him for the first time. It was only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wondered whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side by side but not too close together. He saw that she was about to speak. She moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig.

Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs  \' The phrase \'our new, happy life\' recurred several times. It had been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco. With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week.

When I was a young man, mild beer — wallop we used to call it — was fourpence a pint. That was before the war, of course.\' \'Which war was that?\' said Winston. \'It\'s all wars,\' said the old man vaguely.

She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them. One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on the same root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called to Katharine to come and look at it. \'Look, Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clump down near the bottom.

But there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence. So long as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no harm could come to them. Getting there was difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside it time could be arrested. Often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. Or Katharine would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and Julia would succeed in getting married. Or they would commit suicide together. Or they would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory and live out their lives undetected in a back-street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In reality there was no escape. Even the one plan that was practicable, suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one\'s lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available.

It\'s in Victory Square, alongside the picture gallery. A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps.\' Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds — scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like. \'St Martin\'s-in-the-Fields it used to be called,\' supplemented the old man, \'though I don\'t recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.\' Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for some minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not Weeks — as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shop-front — but Charrington.

The possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for the first time. After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called \'abolition of private property\' which took place in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the Party owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and disposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following the Revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses, transport — everything had been taken away from them: and since these things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be public property.

The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive. CRIMESTOP, they called it in Newspeak. He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself with propositions — \'the Party says the earth is flat\', \'the party says that ice is heavier than water\' — and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as \'two and two make five\' were beyond his intellectual grasp. It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain. All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they would shoot him. \'Everything depends on yourself,\' O\'Brien had said; but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer.

Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the Indian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches and all — an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity and single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy\'s life. He was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty- four-houra-day devotion to duty. He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, and no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting- down of spies, saboteurs, thoughtcriminals, and traitors generally. Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit: in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail. Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones.

All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for \'Science\'. The empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields are cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery. But in matters of vital importance — meaning, in effect, war and police espionage— the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least tolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand.

Then, as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. It was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. Chocolate normally was dull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, like the smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was powerful and troubling. \'Where did you get this stuff?\' he said. \'Black market,\' she said indifferently.

La pièce était déjà comble et le bruit assourdissant. À travers le\ngrillage du comptoir, la fumée du ragoût se répandait avec une aigre odeur\nmétallique qui ne couvrait pas entièrement le fumet du gin de la Victoire. À\nl’extrémité de la pièce, il y avait un petit bar. C’était un simple trou dans\nle mur où l’on pouvait acheter du gin à dix cents le grand verre à liqueur.\n« Voilà tout juste l’homme que\nje cherchais », dit une voix derrière Winston.\nCelui-ci se retourna. C’était son\nami Syme, qui travaillait au Service des Recherches. Peut-être\n« ami » n’était-il pas tout à fait le mot juste. On n’avait pas\nd’amis, à l’heure actuelle, on avait des camarades. Mais il y avait des\ncamarades dont la société était plus agréable que celle des autres. Syme était\nun philologue, un spécialiste en novlangue. À la vérité, il était un des\nmembres de l’énorme équipe d’experts occupés alors à compiler la onzième\nédition du dictionnaire novlangue. C’était un garçon minuscule, plus petit que\nWinston, aux cheveux noirs, aux yeux grands et globuleux, tristes et ironiques\nà la fois. Il paraissait scruter de près, en parlant, le visage de ceux à qui\nil s’adressait.\n— Je voulais vous demander si\nvous avez des lames de rasoir, dit-il.\n— Pas une, répondit Winston\navec une sorte de hâte qui dissimulait un sentiment de culpabilité. J’ai\ncherché partout, il n’en existe plus.\nTout le monde demandait des lames de\nrasoir. Il en avait actuellement deux neuves qu’il gardait précieusement.\nDepuis des mois, une disette de lames sévissait. Il y avait toujours quelque\narticle de première nécessité que les magasins du Parti étaient incapables de\nfournir. Parfois c’étaient les boutons, parfois la laine à repriser. D’autres\nfois, c’étaient les lacets de souliers. C’étaient maintenant les lames de\nrasoir qui manquaient. On ne pouvait mettre la main dessus, quand on y\narrivait, qu’en trafiquant plus ou moins en cachette au marché\n« libre ».\n— Il y a six semaines que je me\nsers de la même lame, ajouta Winston qui mentait.\nLa queue avançait d’une autre\nsaccade. Lorsqu’elle s’arrêta, Winston se retourna encore vers Syme. Chacun\nd’eux préleva, dans une pile qui se trouvait au bord du comptoir, un plateau de\nmétal graisseux.\n— Êtes-vous allé voir hier la\npendaison des prisonniers ? demanda Syme.\n— Je travaillais, répondit\nWinston avec indifférence. Je verrai cela au télécran, je pense.\n— C’est un succédané tout à\nfait insuffisant, dit Syme.\nSes yeux moqueurs dévisageaient\nWinston. « Je vous connais, semblaient-ils dire. Je vous perce à jour. Je\nsais parfaitement pourquoi vous n’êtes pas allé voir ces prisonniers. »\nIntellectuellement, Syme était d’une\northodoxie venimeuse. Il pouvait parler, avec une désagréable jubilation\nsatisfaite, des raids d’hélicoptères sur les villages ennemis, des procès et\ndes confessions des criminels de la pensée, des exécutions dans les caves du\nministère de l’Amour. Pour avoir avec lui une conversation agréable, il fallait\navant tout l’éloigner de tels sujets et le pousser, si possible, à parler de la\ntechnicité du novlangue, matière dans laquelle il faisait autorité et se\nmontrait intéressant. Winston tourna légèrement la tête pour éviter le regard\nscrutateur des grands yeux sombres.\n— C’était une belle pendaison,\ndit Syme, qui revoyait le spectacle. Mais je trouve qu’on l’a gâchée en\nattachant les pieds. J’aime les voir frapper du pied. J’aime surtout, à la fin,\nvoir la langue se projeter toute droite et bleue, d’un bleu éclatant. Ce sont\nces détails-là qui m’attirent.\n— Aux suivants, s’il vous\nplaît ! glapit la « prolétaire » en tablier bleu qui tenait une\nlouche.\nWinston et Syme passèrent leurs\nplateaux sous le grillage. Sur chacun furent rapidement amoncelés les éléments\ndu déjeuner réglementaire : un petit bol en métal plein d’un ragoût d’un\ngris rosâtre, un quignon de pain, un carré de fromage, une timbale de café de\nla Victoire, sans lait, et une tablette de saccharine.\n— Il y a une table là-bas, sous\nle télécran, dit Syme. Nous prendrons un gin en passant.\nLe gin leur fut servi dans des\ntasses chinoises sans anse. Ils se faufilèrent à travers la salle encombrée et\ndéchargèrent leurs plateaux sur la surface métallique d’une table. Sur un coin\nde cette table, quelqu’un avait laissé une plaque de ragoût, immonde brouet\nliquide qui ressemblait à une vomissure. Winston saisit sa tasse de gin,\ns’arrêta un instant pour prendre son élan et avala le liquide médicamenteux à\ngoût d’huile. Des larmes lui firent clignoter les yeux. Il s’aperçut soudain,\nquand il les eut essuyées, qu’il avait faim. Il se mit à avaler des cuillerées\nde ce ragoût qui montrait, au milieu d’une abondante lavasse, des cubes d’une\nspongieuse substance rosâtre qui était probablement une préparation de viande.\nAucun d’eux ne parla avant qu’ils n’eussent vidé leurs récipients. À la table\nqui se trouvait à gauche, un peu en arrière de Winston, quelqu’un parlait avec\nvolubilité, sans arrêt. C’était un baragouinage discordant presque analogue à\nun caquetage d’un canard, qui perçait à travers le vacarme ambiant.\n— Comment va le\ndictionnaire ? demanda Winston en élevant la voix pour dominer le bruit.\n— Lentement, répondit Syme.\nJ’en suis aux adjectifs. C’est fascinant.\nLe visage de Syme s’était\nimmédiatement éclairé au seul mot de dictionnaire. Il poussa de côté le\nrécipient qui avait contenu le ragoût, prit d’une main délicate son quignon de\npain, de l’autre son fromage et se pencha au-dessus de la table pour se faire\nentendre sans crier.\n— La onzième édition est\nl’édition définitive, dit-il.

She was used to judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winston should believe O\'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized opposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein and his underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in. Times beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief. When public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals \'Death to the traitors!\' During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at Goldstein. Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent.

Before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evilsmelling place. They had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in, but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. The majority of them were common criminals, but there were a few political prisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party prisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards, fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene words on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried to restore order.

Between the two branches of the Party there is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious members of the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party. The most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent, are simply marked down by the Thought Police and eliminated. But this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter of principle. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat. In the crucial years, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind of Socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called \'class privilege\' assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent. He did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations such as the Catholic Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years.

It was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother\'s speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. Or again, \"The Times\' of the nineteenth of December had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. Today\'s issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. Winston\'s job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a \'categorical pledge\' were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week. All that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April. As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of \"The Times\' and pushed them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('ca308259-5d44-4329-9dd7-4fc6b5f5d459','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',219,'deprived of the power of speech.

We may be obliged to give him a new identity. His face, his movements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair — even his voice would be different. And you yourself might have become a different person. Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes it is necessary.

Julia had turned a shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O\'Brien boldly. She murmured something that seemed to be assent. \'Good. Then that is settled.\' There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a rather absent-minded air O\'Brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself, then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think better standing.

It was extraordinarily difficult. Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no external records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called England or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been called London. Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raid itself, but he did remember his father\'s hand clutching his own as they hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest.

He could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far end of the room. He approached it, then stopped short. An involuntary cry had broken out of him. \'Go on,\' said O\'Brien. \'Stand between the wings of the mirror. You shall see the side view as well\' He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, grey- coloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He moved closer to the glass. The creature\'s face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird\'s face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful.

Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made. Even the written instructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy. But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty\'s figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty\'s forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all.

There were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again, frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done. But there were other days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never finished — when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over definitions, enormous digressions, quarrels — threats, even, to appeal to higher authority. And then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at cock-crow. The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his head again. The bulletin! But no, they were merely changing the music. He had the map of Africa behind his eyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram: a black arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow horizontally eastward, across the tail of the first. As though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist? His interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful of gin, picked up the white knight and made a tentative move. Check. But it was evidently not the right move, because  Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind.

One of the men had smashed his fist into Julia\'s solar plexus, doubling her up like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for breath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack. Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that was the last he saw of her. He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his mind. He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what they had done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or three hours ago.

He thought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought- criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something subtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox.

Cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down. The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose. The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished.

These people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This last difference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance.

On pouvait présumer que Withers et ses associés étaient alors en\ndisgrâce, mais il n’y avait eu aucun commentaire de l’événement dans la presse\nou au télécran. Ce n’était pas étonnant, car il était rare que les criminels\npolitiques fussent jugés ou même publiquement dénoncés. Les grandes épurations\nembrassant des milliers d’individus, accompagnées du procès public de traîtres\net de criminels de la pensée qui faisaient d’abjectes confessions de leurs\ncrimes et étaient ensuite exécutés, étaient des spectacles spéciaux, montés\nenviron une fois tous les deux ans.

She was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They were passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the earth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia\'s face a few centimetres from his own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was dead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live warm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips. Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster. There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead. Even if it had been less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet.

She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. \'The human sound-track\' he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing — sex. As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but SUBMITTING. It was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate. But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this. They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the performance continued to happen, once a week quite regulariy, whenever it was not impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had two names for it.

À BAS BIG BROTHER y était écrit de haut en bas en lettres assez grandes\npour être lisibles de la porte. C’était d’une stupidité inconcevable, mais il\ncomprit que, même dans sa panique, il n’avait pas voulu, en fermant le livre\nalors que l’encre était humide, tacher le papier crémeux.\nIl retint sa respiration et ouvrit\nla porte. Instantanément, une chaude vague de soulagement le parcourut. Une\nfemme incolore, aux cheveux en mèches, au visage ridé, et qui semblait\naccablée, se tenait devant la porte.\n— Oh ! camarade, dit-elle\nd’une voix lugubre et geignarde, je pensais bien vous avoir entendu rentrer.\nPourriez-vous jeter un coup d’œil sur notre évier ? Il est bouché et…\nC’était Mme Parsons, la femme\nd’un voisin de palier. « Madame » était un mot quelque peu\ndésapprouvé par le Parti. Normalement, on devait appeler tout le monde\n« camarade » – mais avec certaines femmes, on employait « Madame »\ninstinctivement. C’était une femme d’environ trente ans, mais qui paraissait\nbeaucoup plus âgée. On avait l’impression que, dans les plis de son visage, il\ny avait de la poussière. Winston la suivit le long du palier. Ces besognes\nd’amateur, pour des réparations presque journalières, l’irritaient chaque fois.\nLes appartements du bloc de la Victoire étaient anciens (ils avaient été\nconstruits en 1930 environ), et tombaient en morceaux. Le plâtre des plafonds\net des murs s’écaillait continuellement, les conduites éclataient à chaque gelée\ndure, le toit crevait dès qu’il neigeait, le chauffage central marchait\nhabituellement à basse pression, quand, par économie, il n’était pas fermé tout\nà fait. Les réparations, sauf celles qu’on pouvait faire soi-même, devaient\nêtre autorisées par de lointains comités. Elles étaient sujettes à des retards\nde deux ans, même s’il ne s’agissait que d’un carreau de fenêtre.\n— Naturellement, si je viens,\nc’est que Tom n’est pas là, autrement… dit vaguement Mme Parsons.\nL’appartement des Parsons était plus\ngrand que celui de Winston. Il était médiocre d’une autre façon. Tout avait un\nair battu et piétiné, comme si l’endroit venait de recevoir la visite d’un\ngrand et violent animal. Sur le parquet traînaient partout des instruments de\njeu – des bâtons de hockey, des gants de boxe, un ballon de football crevé, un\nshort à l’envers, trempé de sueur. Il y avait sur la table un fouillis de plats\nsales et de cahiers écornés. Sur les murs, on voyait des bannières écarlates\ndes Espions et de la Ligue de la Jeunesse, et un portrait grandeur nature de\nBig Brother. Il y avait l’odeur habituelle de chou cuit, commune à toute la\nmaison, mais qui était ici traversée par un relent de sueur plus accentué. Et\ncette sueur, on s’en apercevait dès la première bouffée – bien qu’il fût difficile\nd’expliquer comment – était la sueur d’une personne pour le moment absente.\nDans une autre pièce, quelqu’un essayait, à l’aide d’un peigne et d’un bout de\npapier hygiénique, d’harmoniser son chant avec la musique militaire que\ncontinuait à émettre le télécran.\n— Ce sont les enfants, dit\nMme Parsons, en jetant un regard à moitié craintif vers la porte. Ils ne\nsont pas sortis aujourd’hui et, naturellement…\nElle avait l’habitude de s’arrêter\nau milieu de ses phrases. L’évier de la cuisine était rempli, presque jusqu’au\nbord, d’une eau verdâtre et sale qui sentait plus que jamais le chou. Winston\ns’agenouilla et examina le joint du tuyau. Il détestait se servir de ses mains,\nil détestait se baisser, ce qui pouvait le faire tousser. Mme Parsons regardait,\nimpuissante.\n— Naturellement, dit-elle, si\nTom était là, il aurait réparé cela tout de suite. Il aime ce genre de travaux.\nIl est tellement adroit de ses mains, Tom.\nParsons était un collègue de Winston\nau ministère de la Vérité. C’était un homme grassouillet mais actif, d’une\nstupidité paralysante, un monceau d’enthousiasmes imbéciles, un de ces esclaves\ndévots qui ne mettent rien en question et sur qui, plus que sur la Police de la\nPensée, reposait la stabilité du Parti. À trente-cinq ans, il venait, contre sa\nvolonté, d’être évincé de la Ligue de la Jeunesse et avant d’obtenir le grade\nqui lui avait ouvert l’accès de cette ligue, il s’était arrangé pour passer\nparmi les Espions une année de plus que le voulait l’âge réglementaire. Au\nministère, il occupait un poste subalterne où l’intelligence n’était pas\nnécessaire, mais il était, par ailleurs, une figure directrice du Comité des\nSports et de tous les autres comités organisateurs de randonnées en commun, de\nmanifestations spontanées, de campagnes pour l’économie et, généralement,\nd’activités volontaires. Il pouvait, entre deux bouffées de sa pipe, vous faire\nsavoir avec une fierté tranquille que, pendant ces quatre dernières années, il\ns’était montré chaque soir au Centre communautaire. Une accablante odeur de\nsueur, inconscient témoignage de l’ardeur qu’il déployait, le suivait partout\net, même, demeurait derrière lui alors qu’il était parti.\n— Avez-vous une clef\nanglaise ? demanda Winston qui tournait et retournait l’écrou sur le\njoint.\n— Une clef anglaise, répéta\nMme Parsons immédiatement devenue amorphe. Je ne sais pas, bien sûr.\nPeut-être que les enfants…\nIl y eut un piétinement de souliers\net les enfants entrèrent au pas de charge dans le living-room, en soufflant sur\nle peigne. Mme Parsons apporta la clef anglaise. Winston fit couler l’eau\net enleva avec dégoût le tortillon de cheveux qui avait bouché le tuyau. Il se\nnettoya les doigts comme il put sous l’eau froide du robinet et retourna dans\nl’autre pièce.\n— Haut les mains ! hurla\nune voix sauvage.\nUn garçon de neuf ans, beau, l’air\npas commode, s’était brusquement relevé de derrière la table et le menaçait de\nson jouet, un pistolet automatique.

Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. They were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He had the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who had once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end. They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave. There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in The Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes — slum tenements, starv 97','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('d88be30f-96c2-435c-929f-3ba7615a217a','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',342,'first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs. He saw now what O\'Brien had meant about seeing the side view. The curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from some malignant disease. \'You have thought sometimes,\' said O\'Brien, \'that my face — the face of a member of the Inner Party — looks old and worn.

The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood. The family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately. Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine would unquestionably have denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalled her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which had brought the sweat out on his forehead. He began telling Julia of something that had happened, or rather had failed to happen, on another sweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago. It was three or four months after they were married. They had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry.

Or we could blot them out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it.\' Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not say anything. O\'Brien continued as though answering a spoken objection: \'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?\' Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he KNEW, that he was in the right. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind — surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of O\'Brien\'s mouth as he looked down at him.

And this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change. The heirs of the French, English, and American revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years — imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole populations— not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive. It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully workedout political theories. But they had been foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious.

A figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him. For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must have followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived. It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enough that she was watching him. Probably she had seen him go into the pub as well. It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away. The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind. The street was a blind alley.

Besides, was it possible, when you were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase? But that question was not answerable yet. The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O\'Brien came in. Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen. \"They\'ve got you too!\' he cried. \'They got me a long time ago,\' said O\'Brien with a mild, almost regretful irony. He stepped aside. From behind him there emerged a broad-chested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand. \'You know this, Winston,\' said O\'Brien. \'Don\'t deceive yourself. You did know it — you have always known it.\' Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think of that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard\'s hand.

It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably — since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner — she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her.

Winston\'s diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard — a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party — an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed — and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the ha1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('ddccc432-4f5b-4384-84b7-ecc17cdfbe72','2024-04-05 05:06:49','2024-04-05 05:06:49','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',29,'La\nthérapeutique n’avait pas agi.

He seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication. When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts.

He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It might easily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing. The mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots into interminable distance. It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were also very much the same — everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another\'s existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same — people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world.

And the Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. There was even a whole sub-section — Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak — engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets and which no Party member, other than those who worked on it, was permitted to look at.

Mais comme cela se passait entre\nprolétaires, cela n’avait aucune importance. Pour toutes les questions de\nmorale, on leur permettait de suivre leur code ancestral. Le puritanisme sexuel\ndu Parti ne leur était pas imposé. L’inversion sexuelle n’était pas punie, le\ndivorce était autorisé. Entre parenthèses, la dévotion religieuse elle-même\naurait été autorisée si les prolétaires avaient manifesté par le moindre signe\nqu’ils la désiraient ou en avaient besoin. Ils étaient au-dessous de toute\nsuspicion. Comme l’exprimait le slogan du Parti : « Les prolétaires\net les animaux sont libres. »\nWinston se baissa et gratta avec\nprécaution son ulcère variqueux qui commençait à le démanger. Ce à quoi on\nrevenait invariablement, était l’impossibilité de savoir ce qu’avait réellement\nété la vie avant la Révolution. Il prit dans son tiroir un exemplaire d’un\nmanuel d’histoire à l’usage des enfants, qu’il avait emprunté à\nMme Parsons, et se mit à en copier un passage dans son journal. Le\nvoici :\nAnciennement, avant la glorieuse\nRévolution, Londres n’était pas la superbe cité que nous connaissons\naujourd’hui. C’était une ville sombre, sale, misérable, où presque personne\nn’avait suffisamment de nourriture, où des centaines et des milliers de pauvres\ngens n’avaient pas de chaussures aux pieds, ni même de toit sous lequel ils\npussent dormir. Des enfants, pas plus âgés que vous, devaient travailler douze\nheures par jour pour des maîtres cruels qui les fouettaient s’ils travaillaient\ntrop lentement et ne les nourrissaient que de croûtes de pain rassis et d’eau.\nAu milieu de cette horrible pauvreté, il y avait quelques belles maisons,\nhautes et larges, où vivaient des hommes riches qui avaient pour les servir\njusqu’à trente domestiques. C’étaient des hommes gras et laids, aux visages\ncruels, comme celui que vous voyez sur l’image de la page ci-contre. Vous\npouvez voir qu’il est vêtu d’une longue veste noire appelée redingote et qu’il\nest coiffé d’un étrange chapeau luisant, en forme de tuyau de poêle, qu’on\nappelait haut-de-forme. C’était l’uniforme des capitalistes, et personne\nd’autre n’avait la permission de le porter.\nLes capitalistes possédaient tout\net tous les autres hommes étaient leurs esclaves. Ils possédaient toute la\nterre, toutes les maisons, toutes les usines, tout l’argent. Ils pouvaient, si\nquelqu’un leur désobéissait, le jeter en prison, ou lui enlever son gagne-pain\net le faire mourir de faim. Quand une personne ordinaire parlait à un\ncapitaliste, elle devait prendre une attitude servile, saluer, enlever sa\ncasquette et donner du « Monseigneur ». Le chef de tous les\ncapitalistes s’appelait le Roi et…\nMais Winston savait le reste de\nl’énumération. On mentionnerait les évêques et leurs manches de fine batiste,\nles juges dans leurs robes d’hermine, les piloris de toutes sortes, les moulins\nde discipline, le chat à neuf queues, le banquet du Lord Maire, la coutume\nd’embrasser l’orteil du pape. Il y avait aussi, ce qu’on appelait le droit\nde cuissage qui n’était probablement pas mentionné dans un livre pour\nenfants. C’était la loi qui donnait aux capitalistes le droit de coucher avec\nn’importe laquelle des femmes qui travaillaient dans leurs usines.\nComment, dans ce récit, faire la\npart du mensonge ? Ce pouvait être vrai, que le niveau humain fût plus\nélevé après qu’avant la Révolution. La seule preuve du contraire était la\nprotestation silencieuse que l’on sentait dans la moelle de ses os, c’était le\nsentiment instinctif que les conditions dans lesquelles on vivait étaient\nintolérables et, qu’à une époque quelconque, elles devaient avoir été différentes.\nL’idée lui vint que la vraie\ncaractéristique de la vie moderne était, non pas sa cruauté, son insécurité,\nmais simplement son aspect nu, terne, soumis.\nLa vie, quand on regardait autour de\nsoi, n’offrait aucune ressemblance, non seulement avec les mensonges qui\ns’écoulaient des télécrans, mais même avec l’idéal que le Parti essayait de\nréaliser. D’importantes tranches de vie, même pour un membre du Parti, étaient\nneutres et en dehors de la politique : peiner à des travaux ennuyeux, se\nbattre pour une place dans le métro, repriser des chaussettes usées, mendier\nune tablette de saccharine, mettre de côté un bout de cigarette. L’idéal fixé\npar le Parti était quelque chose d’énorme, de terrible, de rayonnant, un monde\nd’acier et de béton, de machines monstrueuses et d’armes terrifiantes, une\nnation de guerriers et de fanatiques qui marchaient avec un ensemble parfait,\npensaient les mêmes pensées, clamaient les mêmes slogans, qui perpétuellement\ntravaillaient, luttaient, triomphaient et persécutaient, c’étaient trois cents\nmillions d’êtres aux visages semblables.\nLa réalité montrait des cités\ndélabrées et sales où des gens sous-alimentés traînaient çà et là des\nchaussures crevées, dans des maisons du dix-neuvième siècle rafistolées qui\nsentaient toujours le chou et les cabinets sans confort.\nWinston avait, de Londres, la vision\nd’une cité vaste et en ruine, peuplée d’un million de poubelles et, mêlé à\ncette vision, il voyait un portrait de Mme Parsons, d’une femme au visage\nridé et aux cheveux en mèches, farfouillant sans succès, dans un tuyau de\nvidange bouché.\nIl se baissa et gratta encore son\ncou-de-pied. Tout au long du jour et de la nuit, les télécrans vous cassaient\nles oreilles avec des statistiques qui prouvaient que les gens, aujourd’hui,\navaient plus de nourriture, plus de vêtements, qu’ils avaient des maisons plus\nconfortables, des distractions plus agréables, qu’ils vivaient plus longtemps,\ntravaillaient moins d’heures, étaient plus gros, en meilleure santé, plus\nforts, plus heureux, plus intelligents, mieux élevés que les gens d’il y avait\ncinquante ans. Pas un mot de ces statistiques ne pouvait jamais être prouvé ou\nréfuté.

Est-ce que la nourriture avait toujours eu ce\ngoût-là ? Il jeta un regard circulaire dans la cantine. Une salle comble,\nau plafond bas, aux murs salis par le contact de corps innombrables. Des tables\net des chaises de métal cabossé, placées si près les unes des autres que les\ncoudes des gens se touchaient. Des cuillers tordues. Des plateaux bosselés. De\ngrossières tasses blanches. Toutes les surfaces graisseuses et de la crasse\ndans toutes les fentes. Une odeur composite et aigre de mauvais gin, de mauvais\ncafé, de ragoût métallique et de vêtements sales. On avait toujours dans\nl’estomac et dans la peau une sorte de protestation, la sensation qu’on avait\nété dupé, dépossédé de quelque chose à quoi on avait droit.\nIl était vrai que Winston ne se\nsouvenait de rien qui fût très différent. À aucune époque dont il pût se\nsouvenir avec précision, il n’y avait eu tout à fait assez à manger. On n’avait\njamais eu de chaussettes ou de sous-vêtements qui ne fussent pleins de trous.\nLe mobilier avait toujours été bosselé et branlant, les pièces insuffisamment\nchauffées, les rames de métro bondées, les maisons délabrées, le pain noir. Le\nthé était une rareté, le café avait un goût d’eau sale, les cigarettes étaient\nen nombre insuffisant. Rien n’était bon marché et abondant, à part le gin\nsynthétique. Cet état de chose devenait plus pénible à mesure que le corps\nvieillissait mais, de toute façon, que quelqu’un fût écœuré par l’inconfort, la\nmalpropreté et la pénurie, par les interminables hivers, par les chaussettes\ngluantes, les ascenseurs qui ne marchaient jamais, l’eau froide, le savon\ngréseux, les cigarettes qui tombaient en morceaux, les aliments infects au goût\nétrange, n’était-ce pas un signe que l’ordre naturel des choses était violé.\nPourquoi avait-il du mal à supporter la vie actuelle, si ce n’est qu’il y avait\nune sorte de souvenir ancestral d’une époque où tout était différent ?\nEncore une fois, Winston fit du\nregard le tour de la cantine. Presque tous étaient laids et ils auraient encore\nété laids, même s’ils avaient été vêtus autrement que de la combinaison bleue\nd’uniforme. À l’extrémité de la pièce, assis seul à une table, un petit homme,\nqui ressemblait curieusement à un scarabée, buvait une tasse de café. Ses\npetits yeux lançaient des regards soupçonneux de chaque côté. Comme il est\nfacile à condition d’éviter de regarder autour de soi, pensa Winston, de croire\nque le type physique idéal fixé par le Parti existait, et même\nprédominait : garçons grands et musclés, filles à la poitrine abondante,\nblonds, pleins de vitalité, bronzés par le soleil, insouciants. Actuellement,\nautant qu’il pouvait en juger, la plupart des gens de la Première Région\nAérienne étaient petits, bruns et disgracieux. Il était curieux de constater\ncombien le type scarabée proliférait dans les ministères. On y voyait de petits\nhommes courtauds qui, très tôt, devenaient corpulents. Ils avaient de petites\njambes, des mouvements rapides et précipités, des visages gras sans expression,\nde très petits yeux. C’était le type qui semblait prospérer le mieux sous la\ndomination du Parti.\nL’annonce du ministère de\nl’Abondance s’acheva sur un autre appel de clairon et fit place à une musique\ncriarde. Parsons, que le bombardement des chiffres avait animé d’un vague\nenthousiasme, enleva sa pipe de sa bouche.\n— Le ministère de l’Abondance a\ncertainement fait du bon travail cette année, dit-il en secouant la tête d’un\nair entendu. À propos, vieux Smith, je suppose que vous n’avez aucune lame de\nrasoir à me céder ?\n— Pas une, répondit Winston. Il\ny a six semaines que je me sers de la même lame moi-même.\n— Ah ! bon. Je voulais\nseulement tenter ma chance, vieux.\n— Je regrette, dit Winston.\nLa voix cancanante, à l’autre table,\nmomentanément réduite au silence pendant l’annonce du ministère, avait\nrecommencé à se faire entendre plus forte que jamais.\nWinston se surprit soudain à penser\nà Mme Parsons. Il revoyait ses cheveux en mèches, la poussière des plis de\nson visage. D’ici deux ans, ses enfants la dénonceraient à la Police de la\nPensée. Mme Parsons serait vaporisée. Syme serait vaporisé. Winston serait\nvaporisé. O’Brien serait vaporisé. D’autre part, Parsons, lui, ne serait jamais\nvaporisé. La créature sans yeux à la voix de canard ne serait jamais vaporisée.\nLes petits hommes scarabées qui se hâtaient avec tant d’agilité dans le\nlabyrinthe des couloirs du ministère ne seraient jamais, eux non plus,\nvaporisés. Et la fille aux cheveux noirs, la fille du Commissariat aux Romans,\nelle non plus, ne serait jamais vaporisée. Il semblait à Winston qu’il savait,\ninstinctivement, qui survivrait et qui périrait, bien qu’il ne fût pas facile\nde dire quel élément entraînait la survivance.\nIl sortit à ce moment de sa rêverie\navec un violent sursaut. La fille assise à la table voisine s’était à demi\nretournée et le regardait. C’était la fille aux cheveux noirs. Elle le\nregardait du coin de l’œil, mais avec une curieuse intensité.

His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words I LOVE YOU the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when he was home and in bed — in the darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent — that he was able to think continuously. It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knew that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, but that was of no importance. He thought of her naked, youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! What he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you.

The very word \'war\', therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This — although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense — is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE. Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude and safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek. The book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-rid1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('e43d1acd-c035-45b6-8d97-0322639199cd','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',123,'Though of course you\'d have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.\' There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had already gravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The hunting-down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The old man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed. \'Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all — — \' he began delicately. Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. There was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue. \'The frame\'s fixed to the wall,\' said the old man, \'but I could unscrew it for you, I dare say\' \'I know that building,\' said Winston finally \'It\'s a ruin now. It\'s in the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.\' \"That\'s right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in — oh, many years ago.

He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street, and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen. Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught. But the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of Hate Week. It was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody. Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day. They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked at Julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual. \'It\'s all off,\' she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak. \'Tomorrow, I mean.\' \'What?\' 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('e4c8b3eb-bdd8-43f4-a098-eeeb3f01d281','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',5,'not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered. Behind Winston\'s back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live — did live, from habit that became instinct — in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste — this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy  5','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('e88fe5e8-55d0-4b9d-bb19-18962fb0f11f','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',142,'man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying, two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right. Five seconds later, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl\'s table. He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating. It was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by since she had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must have changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair should end successfully; such things did not happen in real life. He might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston began speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices. \'What time do you leave work?\' \'Eighteen-thirty\' \'Where can we meet?\' 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('ea864f53-e09c-43e1-8994-5e50da3ab785','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',250,'serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practised today would have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible. But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous. When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity. Technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded. As we have seen, researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important. Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed. Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police. Since each of the three super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised.

Winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. But he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with a split second left — to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything had gone black. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea. There was one and only one way to save himself. He must interpose another human being, the BODY of another human being, between himself and the rats. The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. The rats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down, the other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black panic took hold of him.

Nor, in the circumstances, did it strike him as very important or interesting. \'Do you know what time of day it is?\' he said. Ampleforth looked startled again. \'I had hardly thought about it.

At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speaker\'s hand.

Why did it always have to be like this? Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years? But a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event. The women of the Party were all alike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty. By careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had been driven out of them. His reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable, as the Party intended that they should be.

The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it. It also follows that though the past is alterable, it never has been altered in any specific instance. For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version IS the past, and no different past can ever have existed. This holds good even when, as often happens, the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year. At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now. It will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory. To make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act.

All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft. Either they became stupid and arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown; or they became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have used force, and once again were overthrown. They fell, that is to say, either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. It is the achievement of the Party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the Party be made permanent. If one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality. For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one\'s own infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes. It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of DOUBLETHINK are those who invented DOUBLETHINK and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating. In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is. In general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane. One clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale.

Winston stood watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister\'s hand and was fleeing for the door. \'Winston, Winston!\' his mother called after him. \'Come back! Give your sister back her chocolate!\' He stopped, but did not come back. His mother\'s anxious eyes were fixed on his face. Even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening. His sister, conscious of having been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. Something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying. He turned and fled down the stairs, with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand. He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother had disappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister. They had not taken any clothes, not even his mother\'s overcoat. To this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for his sister, she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of the colonies for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which had grown up as a result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the labour 1984','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('f117a19c-76bf-497f-939a-be03dfa60ff8','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',69,'I do so agree with you\', uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just once Winston caught a phrase — complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism\' — jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a quack- quack- quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature. He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought- criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front — it made no difference. Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc. As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. It was not the man\'s brain that was speaking, it was his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but  69','f14fd3fa-7f84-4177-96c6-8115def549a8'),('f17c60ed-87c1-4657-941c-5b29aefcb3f7','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',210,'even that can\'t make the slightest difference.\' \'If you mean confessing,\' she said, \'we shall do that, right enough.

With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands.

Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened — if, indeed, it did happen. Momentarily he caught O\'Brien\'s eye. O\'Brien had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew — yes, he KNEW! — that O\'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. \'I am with you,\' O\'Brien seemed to be saying to him. \'I know precisely what you are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. But don\'t worry, I am on your side!\' And then the flash of intelligence was gone, and O\'Brien\'s face was as inscrutable as everybody else\'s. That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all — perhaps the Brotherhood really existed!

He was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra half-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again.

Disséminées dans Londres, il n’y\navait que trois autres constructions d’apparence et de dimensions analogues.\nElles écrasaient si complètement l’architecture environnante que, du toit du\nbloc de la Victoire, on pouvait les voir toutes les quatre simultanément.\nC’étaient les locaux des quatre ministères entre lesquels se partageait la\ntotalité de l’appareil gouvernemental. Le ministère de la Vérité, qui\ns’occupait des divertissements, de l’information, de l’éducation et des\nbeaux-arts. Le ministère de la Paix, qui s’occupait de la guerre. Le ministère\nde l’Amour qui veillait au respect de la loi et de l’ordre. Le ministère de\nl’Abondance, qui était responsable des affaires économiques. Leurs noms, en\nnovlangue, étaient : Miniver, Minipax, Miniamour, Miniplein.\nLe ministère de l’Amour était le\nseul réellement effrayant. Il n’avait aucune fenêtre. Winston n’y était jamais\nentré et ne s’en était même jamais trouvé à moins d’un kilomètre. C’était un\nendroit où il était impossible de pénétrer, sauf pour affaire officielle, et on\nn’y arrivait qu’à travers un labyrinthe de barbelés enchevêtrés, de portes\nd’acier, de nids de mitrailleuses dissimulés. Même les rues qui menaient aux\nbarrières extérieures étaient parcourues par des gardes en uniformes noirs à\nface de gorille, armés de matraques articulées.\nWinston fit brusquement demi-tour.\nIl avait fixé sur ses traits l’expression de tranquille optimisme qu’il était\nprudent de montrer quand on était en face du télécran. Il traversa la pièce\npour aller à la minuscule cuisine. En laissant le ministère à cette heure, il\navait sacrifié son repas de la cantine. Il n’ignorait pas qu’il n’y avait pas\nde nourriture à la cuisine, sauf un quignon de pain noirâtre qu’il devait\ngarder pour le petit déjeuner du lendemain. Il prit sur l’étagère une bouteille\nd’un liquide incolore, qui portait une étiquette blanche où s’inscrivaient\nclairement les mots « Gin de la Victoire ». Le liquide répandait une\nodeur huileuse, écœurante comme celle de l’eau-de-vie de riz des Chinois.\nWinston en versa presque une pleine tasse, s’arma de courage pour supporter le\nchoc et avala le gin comme une médecine.\nInstantanément, son visage devint\nécarlate et des larmes lui sortirent des yeux. Le breuvage était comme de\nl’acide nitrique et, de plus, on avait en l’avalant la sensation d’être frappé\nà la nuque par une trique de caoutchouc. La minute d’après, cependant, la\nbrûlure de son estomac avait disparu et le monde commença à lui paraître plus\nagréable. Il prit une cigarette dans un paquet froissé marqué « Cigarettes\nde la Victoire », et, imprudemment, la tint verticalement, ce qui fit\ntomber le tabac sur le parquet. Il fut plus heureux avec la cigarette suivante.\nIl retourna dans le living-room et s’assit à une petite table qui se trouvait à\ngauche du télécran. Il sortit du tiroir un porte-plume, un flacon d’encre, un\nin-quarto épais et vierge au dos rouge et à la couverture marbrée.\nLe télécran du living-room était,\npour une raison quelconque, placé en un endroit inhabituel. Au lieu de se\ntrouver, comme il était normal, dans le mur du fond où il aurait commandé toute\nla pièce, il était dans le mur plus long qui faisait face à la fenêtre. Sur un\nde ses côtés, là où Winston était assis, il y avait une alcôve peu profonde\nqui, lorsque les appartements avaient été aménagés, était probablement destinée\nà recevoir des rayons de bibliothèque. Quand il s’asseyait dans l’alcôve, bien\nen arrière, Winston pouvait se maintenir en dehors du champ de vision du\ntélécran. Il pouvait être entendu, bien sûr, mais aussi longtemps qu’il\ndemeurait dans sa position actuelle, il ne pourrait être vu. C’était\nl’aménagement particulier de la pièce qui avait en partie fait naître en lui\nl’idée de ce qu’il allait maintenant entreprendre.\nMais cette idée lui avait aussi été\nsuggérée par l’album qu’il venait de prendre dans le tiroir. C’était un livre\nspécialement beau. Son papier crémeux et lisse, un peu jauni par le temps,\nétait d’une qualité qui n’était plus fabriquée depuis quarante ans au moins.\nWinston estimait cependant que le livre était beaucoup plus vieux que cela. Il\nl’avait vu traîner à la vitrine d’un bric-à-brac moisissant, dans un sordide\nquartier de la ville (lequel exactement, il ne s’en souvenait pas) et avait\nimmédiatement été saisi du désir irrésistible de le posséder. Les membres du\nParti, normalement, ne devaient pas entrer dans les boutiques ordinaires (cela\ns’appelait acheter au marché libre), mais la règle n’était pas strictement observée,\ncar il y avait différents articles, tels que les lacets de souliers, les lames\nde rasoir, sur lesquels il était impossible de mettre la main autrement. Il\navait d’un rapide coup d’œil parcouru la rue du haut en bas, puis s’était\nglissé dans la boutique et avait acheté le livre deux dollars cinquante. Il\nn’avait pas conscience, à ce moment-là, que son désir impliquât un but\ndéterminé. Comme un criminel, il avait emporté dans sa serviette ce livre qui,\nmême sans aucun texte, était compromettant.\nCe qu’il allait commencer, c’était\nson journal. Ce n’était pas illégal (rien n’était illégal, puisqu’il n’y avait\nplus de lois), mais s’il était découvert, il serait, sans aucun doute, puni de\nmort ou de vingt-cinq ans au moins de travaux forcés dans un camp. Winston\nadapta une plume au porte-plume et la suça pour en enlever la graisse. Une\nplume était un article archaïque, rarement employé, même pour les signatures.\nIl s’en était procuré une, furtivement et avec quelque difficulté, simplement\nparce qu’il avait le sentiment que le beau papier crémeux appelait le tracé\nd’une réelle plume plutôt que les ','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('f5f4363a-8b75-40f4-bd2a-7b91ce732b88','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',355,'an intellectual discipline.

C’est au square de la Victoire,\ncontigu à la galerie de peinture ; un édifice qui a une sorte de porche\ntriangulaire, des piliers en avant et un escalier monumental.\nWinston connaissait bien l’endroit.\nC’était un musée affecté à des expositions de propagande de diverses\nsortes : modèles réduits de bombes volantes et de Forteresses flottantes,\ntableaux en cire illustrant les atrocités de l’ennemi, et ainsi de suite.\n— On l’appelait\nSaint-Martin-des-Champs, ajouta le vieillard, bien que je ne me souvienne\nd’aucun champ de ce côté.\nWinston n’acheta pas le tableau. Le\nposséder eût été encore plus incongru que posséder le presse-papier de verre,\net Winston n’aurait pu le transporter chez lui, à moins de l’enlever de son\ncadre. Mais il s’attarda quelques minutes de plus à parler au vieillard. Il\ndécouvrit que le nom de celui-ci n’était pas Weeks, comme on aurait pu le\ncroire d’après l’inscription de la façade du magasin, mais Charrington.\nM. Charrington était,\nsemblait-il, un veuf de soixante-trois ans et habitait ce magasin depuis trente\nans. Il avait toujours eu l’intention de changer le nom qui était au-dessus de\nla fenêtre, mais ne s’y était jamais décidé. Pendant qu’ils causaient, la\nmoitié de la chanson rappelée continua à trotter dans le cerveau de Winston.\n« Oranges et citrons, disent les cloches de Saint-Clément. Tu me dois\ntrois farthings, disent les cloches de Saint-Martin. » C’était curieux,\nmais quand on se le disait, on avait l’illusion d’entendre réellement des\ncloches, les cloches d’un Londres perdu qui existerait encore quelque part,\ndéguisé et oublié. D’un clocher fantôme à un autre, il lui semblait les\nentendre sonner à toute volée. Pourtant, autant qu’il pouvait s’en souvenir, il\nn’avait jamais entendu, dans la vie réelle, sonner des cloches d’église.\nIl laissa M. Charrington et\ndescendit seul l’escalier, pour que le vieillard ne le vît pas étudier la rue\navant de franchir la porte. Il avait déjà décidé qu’après un laps de temps\nraisonnable, disons un mois, il se risquerait à faire une nouvelle visite au\nmagasin. Ce n’était peut-être pas plus dangereux que d’esquiver une soirée au\nCentre. L’acte de folie le plus grave avait été d’abord de revenir là après\navoir acheté l’album et sans savoir s’il pouvait se fier au propriétaire du\nmagasin. Cependant !…\n« Oui, pensa-t-il encore, je\nreviendrai. J’achèterai d’autres échantillons de beaux laissés pour compte,\nj’achèterai la gravure de Saint-Clément, je l’enlèverai du cadre et la\nrapporterai chez moi cachée sous le haut de ma combinaison. J’extrairai le\nreste de la chanson de la mémoire de M. Charrington. »\nMême le projet fou de louer la\nchambre du premier traversa encore son esprit. Pendant cinq secondes,\npeut-être, l’exaltation le rendit inattentif et il sortit sur le trottoir sans\nmême un coup d’œil préliminaire par la fenêtre. Il avait même commencé à\nfredonner sur un air improvisé :\nOranges et citrons, disent les\ncloches de Saint-Clément,\nTu me dois trois farthings,\ndisent les…\nSon cœur se glaça soudain, et il\nsentit ses entrailles se fondre. Une silhouette revêtue de la combinaison bleue\ndescendait le trottoir à moins de dix mètres. C’était la fille du Commissariat\naux Romans, la fille aux cheveux noirs. La lumière baissait, mais il n’était\npas difficile de la reconnaître. Elle le regarda en face, puis continua\nrapidement, comme si elle ne l’avait pas vu.\nPendant quelques secondes, Winston\nse trouva trop paralysé pour se mouvoir. Puis il tourna à droite et s’en alla\nlourdement, sans remarquer à ce moment qu’il s’engageait dans une mauvaise\ndirection. De toute façon, une question était réglée. Il ne pouvait plus douter\nque la fille l’espionnait. Elle devait l’avoir suivi. Il n’était pas\nvraisemblable, en effet, qu’un pur hasard ait conduit sa promenade, le même\naprès-midi, dans la même rue obscure et écartée que Winston, à des kilomètres\nde distance des quartiers où vivaient les membres du Parti. C’était une\ncoïncidence trop grande. Qu’elle fût réellement un agent de la Police de la\nPensée, ou simplement un espion amateur poussé par un zèle indiscret, importait\npeu. Le principal était qu’elle le surveillait. Elle l’avait probablement aussi\nvu entrer dans le café.\nIl lui fallait faire un effort pour\nmarcher. Dans sa poche, le morceau de verre lui frappait la cuisse à chaque pas\net il eut presque envie de le jeter. Le pire était le mal au ventre. Pendant\ndeux secondes, il sentit qu’il mourrait s’il n’arrivait pas tout de suite à un\nwater. Mais il ne devait pas y avoir de water public dans un tel quartier. Puis\nle spasme disparut, laissant une douleur sourde.\nLa rue était une impasse. Winston\ns’arrêta, resta quelques secondes immobile à se demander vaguement ce qu’il\nallait faire, puis revint sur ses pas. Il pensa alors que la fille l’avait\ncroisé il n’y avait que trois minutes, et qu’en courant il pourrait la\nrattraper. Il la suivrait jusqu’à ce qu’ils fussent en quelque endroit désert\net il lui briserait le crâne avec un pavé. Le morceau de verre qu’il avait dans\nla poche serait assez lourd. Mais il abandonna tout de suite cette idée, car\nmême la pensée d’un effort physique quelconque était insupportable. Il ne\npourrait courir, il ne pourrait assener un coup. En outre, elle était jeune et\nrobuste et se défendrait.\nWinston pensa aussi à se rendre\nrapidement au Centre communautaire et à y rester jusqu’à la fermeture pour\nétablir un alibi partiel pour l’après-midi. Mais cela aussi était impossible.\nUne lassitude mortelle l’avait saisi.

When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have got to relearn, Winston.

Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others.

Il était assis, les yeux fixés sur\nla couverture marbrée du livre, et il essayait sans succès de ne pas écouter la\nvoix.\nC’était toujours la nuit qu’ils\nvenaient vous prendre. Toujours la nuit ! La seule chose à faire était de\nse tuer avant. Sans doute, quelques personnes le faisaient. Beaucoup de\ndisparitions étaient réellement des suicides. Mais il fallait un courage\ndésespéré pour se tuer dans un monde où on ne pouvait se procurer ni arme à\nfeu, ni poison rapide et sûr. Il pensa avec une sorte d’étonnement à\nl’inutilité biologique de la souffrance et de la frayeur, à la perfidie du\ncorps humain qui toujours se fige et devient inerte à l’instant précis où un\neffort spécial est nécessaire. Il aurait pu réduire au silence la fille aux\ncheveux noirs si seulement il avait agi assez vite. Mais c’était précisément\nl’imminence du danger qui lui avait fait perdre le pouvoir d’agir. Il pensa\nqu’aux moments de crise, ce n’est pas contre un ennemi extérieur qu’on lutte,\nmais toujours contre son propre corps. En cet instant même, en dépit du gin, la\ndouleur sourde qu’il sentait au ventre rendait impossibles des réflexions\nsuivies.\nIl en est de même, comprit-il, dans\ntoutes les situations qui semblent héroïques ou tragiques.

Il fallait y\nécrire quelque chose. La femme du télécran avait commencé une autre chanson. Sa\nvoix semblait s’enfoncer dans le cerveau comme des éclats pointus de verre\nbrisé. Il essaya de penser à O’Brien pour qui ou à qui il écrivait, mais sa\npensée se porta sur ce qui lui arriverait après son arrestation par la Police\nde la Pensée. Si on était tué tout de suite, cela n’aurait pas d’importance.\nÊtre tué était ce à quoi on s’attendait. Mais avant la mort, (personne n’en\nparlait, mais tout le monde le savait), il fallait passer par l’habituelle\nroutine de la confession : ramper sur le sol en criant grâce, sentir le\ncraquement des os que l’on brise, des dents que l’on émiette et des touffes de\ncheveux sanguinolents que l’on vous arrache. Pourquoi devait-on supporter cela,\npuisque la fin était toujours la même ? Pourquoi n’était-il pas possible\nde supprimer de sa vie quelques jours, ou quelques semaines ? Personne\nn’échappait à la surveillance et personne ne manquait de se confesser.\nLorsqu’on avait une fois succombé au crime par la pensée, on pouvait être\ncertain qu’à une date donnée on serait mort. Pourquoi cette horreur, qui ne\nchangeait rien, devait-elle être comprise dans l’avenir ?\nIl essaya, cette fois avec un peu\nplus de succès, d’évoquer l’image d’O’Brien.\n— Nous nous rencontrerons là où\nil n’y a pas de ténèbres, lui avait dit O’Brien.\nIl savait ce que cela signifiait, ou\npensait le savoir.

Il porta\nune cigarette à sa bouche. La moitié du tabac lui tomba tout de suite sur la\nlangue. C’était une poussière amère qu’il eut du mal à recracher. Le visage de\nBig Brother se glissa dans son esprit, effaçant celui d’O’Brien. Comme il\nl’avait fait quelques jours plus tôt, il tira une pièce de monnaie de sa poche\net la regarda. Dans le visage lourd, calme, protecteur, les yeux regardaient\nWinston. Mais quelle sorte de sourire se cachait sous la moustache noire ?\nComme le battement lourd d’un glas, les mots de la devise lui revinrent :\n \nLA GUERRE C’EST LA PAIX\nLA LIBERTÉ C’EST L’ESCLAVAGE\nL’IGNORANCE C’EST LA FORCE\n \n\n\nTable of ','ca9669f2-1908-4c8c-b3ce-38bdb2d04b62'),('fd9e4655-e829-4124-8198-9aadaa5ef5b5','2023-11-21 15:00:00','2023-11-21 15:00:00','73dc5c93-7837-4824-8901-5a02b89d05f0',337,'any longer.
